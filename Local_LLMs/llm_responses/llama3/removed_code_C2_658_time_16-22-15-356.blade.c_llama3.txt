3) This code snippet checks if a condition is met (n < 0), and if so, it aborts the program. This behavior is crucial for the program's security as it prevents potential errors or exceptions from occurring when n is less than 0. Removing this code could lead to unforeseen consequences and compromise the program's integrity.
