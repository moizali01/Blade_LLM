3) This code snippet is critical for the correctness of the hash table's insertion and lookup operations. It sets the entry's data pointer to NULL, indicating that the entry is no longer in use, and links it to the free entry list. Without this code, the program would likely crash or exhibit unexpected behavior when attempting to reuse freed entries.
