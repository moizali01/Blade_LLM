3) The code snippet is a conditional statement that checks if the size of ptrdiff_t is less than or equal to the size of size_t. If true, it sets tmp to -1; otherwise, it sets tmp to -2. This condition affects the behavior of xmalloc and xrealloc functions, which are critical for memory management in the program. Removing this code could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes when allocating memory.
