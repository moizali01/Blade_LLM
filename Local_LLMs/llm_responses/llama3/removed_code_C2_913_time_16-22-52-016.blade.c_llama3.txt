3) The code snippet is only used to set a flag (`sp->fts_options |= 8192;`) and doesn't have any significant impact on the program's functionality or security. Removing this code won't affect the overall generality of the program, but it might cause some minor issues if the flag is relied upon elsewhere in the code.
