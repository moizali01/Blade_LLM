3) The code snippet checks if a directory is empty or not by reading the contents of the directory using readdir(). This function returns a NULL pointer when there are no more entries in the directory, indicating it's empty. Removing this code would likely break the functionality of checking for empty directories and could lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the program.
