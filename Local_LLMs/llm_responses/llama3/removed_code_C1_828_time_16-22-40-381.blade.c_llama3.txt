3) The code snippet `extern __attribute__((__nothrow__)) __uid_t(__attribute__((__leaf__)) geteuid)(void);` is not directly used within the given context and seems to be a redundant declaration. Removing this code snippet will not significantly impact the program's functionality or security, making it safe to remove.
