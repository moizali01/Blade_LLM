Response from mistral:
 1) Importance Score : 2
2) Do not Remove
3) The code snippet declares and initializes two pointers, `tmp___6` and `tmp`, both of type `int*`. Without knowing the context in which this code is used, it's difficult to assess its importance. However, since it doesn't appear to be directly related to the security implications of the given snippet, we can assume that its removal wouldn't significantly impact the generality, functionality or security of the entire program. Nevertheless, without further context, it's impossible to say for certain. Thus, it's safer to err on the side of caution and not remove this code.
