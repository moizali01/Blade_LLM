3) The code appears to be responsible for freeing memory allocated during the use of the FTS (File Tree Traversal) library. Removing it could lead to memory leaks and potential program crashes or unexpected behavior. Additionally, this code also handles the case where the current working directory needs to be restored after a recursive traversal, which is an important functionality for the correct operation of the FTS library in certain scenarios.
