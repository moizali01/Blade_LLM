3) The textdomain("coreutils") call sets the message catalog used by gettext() functions for localization. Removing it would prevent proper localization of error messages and other user-facing strings in the program, making it less accessible to non-English speaking users and potentially reducing its usability. Additionally, not setting the domain correctly could lead to incorrect translations or unintended mixing of strings from different domains, introducing potential security risks through confused deputy attacks.
