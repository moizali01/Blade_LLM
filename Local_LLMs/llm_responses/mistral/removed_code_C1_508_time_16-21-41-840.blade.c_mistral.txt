3) The given code snippet is a part of the FTS (File Treewalking) library, which is used for recursively traversing directories and finding files that match certain criteria. This specific code snippet appears to be implementing a sorting function for the FTS data structures. Removing it could lead to unpredictable behavior when dealing with large or complex directory structures, as the order of the traversal might not be consistent without this sorting functionality.
