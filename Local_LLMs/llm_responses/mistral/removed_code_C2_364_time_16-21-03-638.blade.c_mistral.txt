3) The code snippet `_Bool nostat;` is not directly related to the function `lstatat()`. However, it is used within two functions (`remove_file()` and `nonexistent_file_errno()`) that are important for handling file operations. Removing it could potentially introduce unintended consequences or errors in these functions.
