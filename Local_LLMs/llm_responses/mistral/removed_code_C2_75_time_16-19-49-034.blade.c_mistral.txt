3) The code snippet is handling unexpected failures during the file traversal operation by reporting an error message and aborting the program. Removing it could result in silent errors or unexpected behavior, which could potentially pose a security risk if an attacker can manipulate the file system to trigger the unexpected failure condition. Additionally, losing this functionality would impact the robustness of the program, making it less able to handle edge cases gracefully.
