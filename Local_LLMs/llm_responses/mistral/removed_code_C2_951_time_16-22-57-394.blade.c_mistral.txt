3) The typedef declaration for uintmax_t is used throughout the codebase and appears to be an essential part of data types being used. Removing it could potentially introduce type-related errors or issues with the existing functionality of the program. Additionally, since this code snippet is also used in other parts of the function, its removal may impact the consistency and reliability of those sections as well.
