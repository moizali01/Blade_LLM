 1) Importance Score : 1
The given code snippet is a local variable declaration and assignment, it doesn't seem to have significant impact on the entire program's generality, functionality or security.

2) Do not Remove
Removing this code without understanding its context in the entire program could potentially lead to compiler errors or unexpected behavior.

3) The code snippet is used to declare and assign a local pointer variable 'tmp___7', which might be utilized somewhere else in the code, removing it could result in compilation errors or unexpected behavior if another part of the code relies on this variable. Without further context, it's impossible to say for certain if it can be removed or not.
