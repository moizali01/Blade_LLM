3) These code snippets seem to be declaring local variables with the same name "tmp". Without seeing the context of how these variables are used, it is difficult to determine their significance to the program. However, since they appear to be related based on their names and locations in the code, removing one could potentially lead to unintended consequences if the other variable is still being used elsewhere in the code.
