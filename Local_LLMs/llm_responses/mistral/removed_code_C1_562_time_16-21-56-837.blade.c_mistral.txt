3) The code snippet `fts_lfree` is responsible for freeing the memory allocated by the function `fts_palloc`. Removing this code would result in a memory leak, which can lead to several security vulnerabilities such as exhaustion of system resources and potential attacks on the application. Moreover, it also affects the functionality of the program as it may cause the application to consume excessive amounts of memory leading to poor performance or even crashes.
