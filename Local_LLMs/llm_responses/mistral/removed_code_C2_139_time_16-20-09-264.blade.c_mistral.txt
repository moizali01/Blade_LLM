3) The given code snippet does not seem to have a significant impact on the generality, functionality or security of the entire program as it only declares three local variables and assigns them values. Without further context, it is difficult to determine if these variables are used elsewhere in the code. However, since they are local variables, their removal would not necessarily cause any harm unless they are relied upon by other parts of the code.
