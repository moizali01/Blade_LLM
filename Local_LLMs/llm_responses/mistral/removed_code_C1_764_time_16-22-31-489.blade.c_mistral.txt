3) The code snippet is a part of a larger function `opendir_safer()` which checks if the given directory is empty or not. Removing it might affect the functionality of the `opendir_safer()` function and make it unable to determine if a directory is empty or not, leading to potential security vulnerabilities in other parts of the code where this check is used.
