3) This code snippet is used to update the `fts_pathlen` variable with the length of the filename `p->fts_name`. It also copies the filename into `sp->fts_path` and updates other variables. Removing this snippet might result in unexpected behavior or errors, as it seems essential for the functioning of the `fts_close()` function.
