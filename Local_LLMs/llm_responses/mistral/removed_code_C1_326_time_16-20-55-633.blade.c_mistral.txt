3) The code snippet is responsible for handling file type checking and directory traversal during a file traversal operation. Removing it could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities if the correct file type checks are not in place or if the directory traversal function is misused. It also affects the functionality of the file traversal operation as it determines whether to continue processing a file based on its type and number of links.
