3) The `triple_compare_ino_str` function is used as a key comparison function for a hash table (triple\_hash), which is likely used to efficiently lookup structures in the program based on their name and inode number. Removing it may lead to incorrect or slower functionality, as well as potential security implications if the hash table is being used for access control or other sensitive operations.
