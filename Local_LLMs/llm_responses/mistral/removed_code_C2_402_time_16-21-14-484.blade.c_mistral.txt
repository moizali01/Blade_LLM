3) The given code snippet is part of the FTS (File Tree Walker) library in C, which is used for recursively traversing a file hierarchy. Removing it could cause unintended consequences to the program as it affects the functionality and security of the file traversal operation. For instance, removing it may result in an infinite loop during the file traversal or prevent the correct handling of certain directory entries, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.
