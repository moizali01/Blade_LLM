3) The given code snippet is used in the LCO\_compare function, which seems to be involved in comparing the dev and inode numbers of file entries. Its removal could potentially affect the functionality of the program as it may lead to incorrect comparisons of file entries based on their dev and inode numbers. Additionally, without this code, there might not be a secure way to ensure that duplicate file entries with the same dev and inode numbers are not processed multiple times during a file traversal operation.
