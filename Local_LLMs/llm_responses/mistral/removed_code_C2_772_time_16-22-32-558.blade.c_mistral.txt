3) The code snippet `extern __attribute__((__nothrow__)) int( __attribute__((__nonnull__(1, 2), __leaf__)) lstat)(char const *__restrict __file, struct stat *__restrict __buf);` is part of the system call interface for getting file status. It is used in the `lstatat()` function and is essential for the proper functioning of the program. Removing it would compromise the ability to obtain file status information, which could impact the overall security and functionality of the program.
