3) This code snippet is part of the FTS (File TreeWalking System) library, which is used for recursively traversing directories and files. It appears to be a function that retrieves file status information using the stat() system call. Removing this code could potentially result in errors or unexpected behavior when using the FTS library to traverse files and directories, as it would no longer be able to obtain file status information.
