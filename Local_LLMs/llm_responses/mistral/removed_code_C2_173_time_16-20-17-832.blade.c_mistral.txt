The given code snippet does not seem to have a significant impact on the generality, functionality or security of the entire program as it is only declaring a local character pointer variable.

2) Remove
Removing this code snippet will not cause any functional issues and is safe to do as it only affects a local variable declaration.

3) Explanation: The code snippet in question only declares a local character pointer variable 'tmp___14'. Since it is local, its scope is limited to the function or block where it is defined. Therefore, removing it will not affect the overall functionality or security of the program.
