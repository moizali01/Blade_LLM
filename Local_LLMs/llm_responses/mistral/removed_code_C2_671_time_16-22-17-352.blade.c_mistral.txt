 1) Importance Score : 2
2) Don't Remove
3) The given code snippet does not seem to have any specific importance to the entire program as it only declares a local variable 'tmp___0'. However, without further context or understanding of the surrounding code, it is impossible to determine if this variable is being used elsewhere in the program. Thus, removing it could potentially introduce unintended consequences or errors.
