2) Do not Remove
3) The code snippet appears to be part of a file permission check, possibly for a file system call. Its removal may lead to unintended consequences such as incorrect permissions being granted or denied, and may compromise the overall security of the program. Additionally, without this code, it is unclear if the rest of the function will even compile properly.
