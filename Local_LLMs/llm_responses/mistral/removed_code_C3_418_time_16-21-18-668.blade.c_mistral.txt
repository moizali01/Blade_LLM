2) Do not Remove
3) The code snippet declares a variable 'len' of size_t type, which is likely used elsewhere in the program. Removing it could lead to undefined behavior or compilation errors if it is referenced later in the code. Additionally, without knowing the context of how this variable is being used, it is impossible to determine if its removal would have any security implications.
