3) The code snippet is the return statement of the 'rm' function, which initializes 'rm_status' with a value of RM_OK. Removing it would cause the function to not return any value and potentially lead to undefined behavior when calling this function in other parts of the codebase. Additionally, understanding the context of the entire program is necessary before making a definitive conclusion on security implications.
