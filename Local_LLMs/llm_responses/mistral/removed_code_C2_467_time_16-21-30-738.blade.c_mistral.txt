3) The code snippet `free((void *)sp);` is used to free the memory allocated for an FTSENT structure `sp`. If removed, it could lead to memory leaks and cause the application to consume excessive memory over time. Moreover, since this function `fts_lfree()` is responsible for releasing the memory of all FTSENT structures in the linked list, its removal would impact the overall functionality and security of the program as it might result in resource exhaustion or potential out-of-memory errors.
