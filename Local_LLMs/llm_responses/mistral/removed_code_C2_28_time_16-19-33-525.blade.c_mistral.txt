 1) Importance Score : 1
This specific code snippet does not seem to have a significant impact on the entire program's generality, functionality, or security as it is only declared but not used. The variables tmp, tmp___5, tmp___6, and tmp___7 are local to their respective scopes and do not interact with other parts of the code.

2) Remove
There is no need to keep this unused code snippet in the program as it does not contribute to its functionality or security. Removing it will result in a cleaner and more efficient codebase.

3) Explanation:
The given code snippet is a declaration of local variables with similar names, which are not used within their respective scopes. Since they are not referenced anywhere in the code, it is safe to assume that they serve no purpose and can be removed without affecting the program's functionality or security.
