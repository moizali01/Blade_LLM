2) Don't Remove
3) This code snippet is declared but not used, and it appears to be a local variable declaration with the same name as another one in the same scope. Removing it would have no impact on the functionality or security of the program. However, since it is not used, it may be considered unnecessary clutter in the code. But, without more context, it is impossible to definitively say that it can be safely removed.
