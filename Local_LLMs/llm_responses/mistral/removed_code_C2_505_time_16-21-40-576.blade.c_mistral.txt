3) This code snippet is responsible for checking if the new directory being considered for a change of working directory is the parent directory (represented by ".."). If it is, the function checks to ensure that the current and new directories are indeed the same before proceeding with the change. Removing this could potentially allow unintended changes to the working directory during file traversal operations, leading to potential security vulnerabilities or functionality issues.
