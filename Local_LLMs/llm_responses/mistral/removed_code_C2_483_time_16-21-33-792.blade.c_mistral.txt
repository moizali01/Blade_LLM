Response from mistral:
 1) Importance Score : 2
The given code snippets declare and assign memory addresses to variables named "tmp" twice. This has a very limited impact on the entire program's generality, functionality, and security as these declarations are local to the context provided.

2) Do not Remove
Removing these lines would introduce inconsistencies in variable names within the given code snippets. It is essential to maintain consistent naming conventions throughout a codebase for better code readability and understandability.

3) Explanation:
Maintaining consistent variable names ensures that developers can easily follow the logic flow, reducing the risk of introducing errors or security vulnerabilities while modifying the code. Since the given code snippets have identical declarations but different types, removing one would create an inconsistency in the codebase and might lead to unintended consequences when the remaining lines are executed.
