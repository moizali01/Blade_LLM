3) The function file_type() is used to determine the file type based on the stat structure passed to it. Removing this code would result in loss of functionality for determining file types, which could impact the program's ability to perform certain tasks. Additionally, not having a way to determine file types may introduce security vulnerabilities if the application relies on knowing the file type for access control or data validation purposes.
