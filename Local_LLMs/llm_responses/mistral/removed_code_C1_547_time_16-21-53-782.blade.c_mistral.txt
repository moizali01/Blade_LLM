3) The given code snippet is used to open a directory with the `openat_safer()` function and check if it exists. It also sets the close-on-exec flag for the new file descriptor. This functionality is essential for proper functioning of the `fdopendir()` call, as it ensures that the directory is closed when the process terminates or changes directories. Removing this code could lead to resource leaks and potential security vulnerabilities if directories are not properly closed.
