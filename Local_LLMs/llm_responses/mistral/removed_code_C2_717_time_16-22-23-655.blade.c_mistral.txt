3) Explanation: The `version_etc` function plays an essential role in generating the software's metadata, which includes version and author details. Its removal could negatively impact the software's ability to provide accurate and complete information about the releases, making it harder for developers and users to determine which version they are using and when upgrades or bug fixes should be applied. Moreover, not providing this essential information may lead to non-compliance with industry standards and best practices.
