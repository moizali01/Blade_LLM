3) The code snippet is responsible for managing the free list of hash table entries, allowing efficient recycling of memory and reducing memory fragmentation. Removing it would lead to increased memory usage and potential performance issues due to excessive garbage collection. Additionally, this could impact the security of the program if the hash table was used in a context where conserving memory was crucial, such as in real-time systems or embedded devices.
