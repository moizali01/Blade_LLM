3) The given code snippet is assigned to local variables "size" and "ilim". Without seeing the context of how these variables are used within the function, it's difficult to determine their significance. However, since they appear twice with similar variable names, it could be assumed that they have some role in handling input data or managing loops. Removing them without understanding their purpose may cause unexpected behavior or errors in the code.
