3) The given code snippet 'extern DIR *fdopendir(int __fd)' is a function prototype declaration for an external function. It seems unrelated to the functions 'opendir_safer' and 'is_empty_dir', as they use 'opendir' instead of 'fdopendir'. Therefore, removing it might cause compilation errors if this function is used elsewhere in the codebase.
