3) The code snippet is checking the maximum length of strings being compared. Removing it could lead to buffer overflows or other security vulnerabilities if the input strings are not properly checked for size before use. The function is iterating through multibyte characters, so setting a limit on the string length is important for preventing potential attacks.
