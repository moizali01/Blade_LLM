3) The given code snippet is not directly related to the function `fts_load`. It appears to be defining a variable `dev_t fts_dev` outside of any function. However, since it is not being used in this specific context and there does not seem to be any connection between this variable and the rest of the code, removing it would not impact the functionality or security of the program significantly. However, since we cannot be entirely certain that this variable might not be needed elsewhere in the codebase, it is best to err on the side of caution and keep it.
