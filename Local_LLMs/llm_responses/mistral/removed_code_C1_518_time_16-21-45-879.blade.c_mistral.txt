3) The code snippet checks if the size of a pointer to a local variable "dummy" is equal to the size of a void pointer. If it is, it sets the value of a function pointer "tmp" to point to a member function of a structure, otherwise it sets "tmp" to point to an external function. This behavior is crucial for proper functioning of the surrounding code that handles file traversal and processing based on different conditions.

Therefore, removing this code snippet can potentially lead to unexpected behavior or even program crashes, depending on the context in which it is used. Additionally, since this code appears multiple times within the given function, its removal could introduce inconsistencies or errors that are difficult to detect and troubleshoot.
