3) The code snippet `fts_build` is used multiple times within the function `fts_load`. It appears to construct a new FTSENT (file type entry) node. Removing it would likely cause issues with the overall functionality of the program, as it seems to be an essential part of processing directory entries during a file tree traversal.
