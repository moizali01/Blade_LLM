3) The given code snippet appears unrelated to the other variables declared in the context provided as it doesn't seem to be used or related to any function or structure in the program. However, removing unused or unreferenced code is generally a good practice for maintaining cleaner and more efficient codebases. Since we don't have enough context about the potential impact on the entire program's functionality or security, it would be safer not to remove this particular snippet without further investigation.
