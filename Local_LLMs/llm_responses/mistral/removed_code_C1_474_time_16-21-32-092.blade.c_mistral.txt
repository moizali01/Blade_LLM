3) The code snippet is responsible for freeing memory allocated to the child node of a tree structure used by the file traversal system call (fts). Removing it would result in memory leaks and potential resource exhaustion, which can lead to security vulnerabilities and program crashes. Additionally, it is an essential part of the proper functioning of the fts library, as it allows for recursive directory traversals.
