3) The code snippet being discussed is the declaration of the 'strlen' function, which is a standard C library function used to determine the length of a string. It is a widely used function in C programming and plays an essential role in the functionality of many programs. Removing it could potentially break existing functionalities that rely on this function.

Additionally, from a security perspective, the removal of 'strlen' may not directly impact the security of the entire program, but it could indirectly affect the security by making it harder to maintain proper bounds checking or memory management, which are crucial aspects of secure programming.
