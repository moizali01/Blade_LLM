3) The code snippet appears to declare three variables, but it is unclear what they are used for without additional context. However, since the variables are local to this function and their scope is limited, removing them may cause compile errors or unexpected behavior if those variables have specific roles in the execution of the code. It is best to keep them until their purpose and potential impact on the program can be fully understood.
