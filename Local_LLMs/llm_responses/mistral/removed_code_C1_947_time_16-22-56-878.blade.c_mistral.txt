3) The code snippet defines the struct `dirent` which is used by the functions `readdir()` and `is_empty_dir()`. These functions are crucial for interacting with directories in a file system, and therefore, removing this code would significantly impact the program's functionality. Additionally, there are no apparent security concerns associated with this code snippet, as it only deals with directory structure data and does not involve user input or other sensitive information.
