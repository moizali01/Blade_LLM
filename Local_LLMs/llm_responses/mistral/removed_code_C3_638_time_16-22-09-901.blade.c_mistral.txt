3) The code snippet initializes the 'sbp' struct stat variable with zeros before using it, which can prevent potential security vulnerabilities from using uninitialized memory. It is a common practice to ensure that memory is properly initialized, especially when dealing with system calls or file I/O operations. Removing this code could potentially introduce security risks or unexpected behavior in the program.
