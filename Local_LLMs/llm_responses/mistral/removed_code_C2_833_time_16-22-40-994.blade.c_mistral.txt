3) The `is_basic` function is used as a helper function within the `mbuiter_multi_next` function. It checks if a given character is considered "basic" or not based on a lookup table (`is_basic_table`). Removing it could potentially affect the behavior of `mbuiter_multi_next`, and thus the larger context in which it's used, such as functions that rely on it. It does not seem to pose any significant security risks.
