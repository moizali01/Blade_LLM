3) The given code snippet is a part of an inline function "lstatat" which is used for getting file status information. It utilizes other system calls like faccessat, unlinkat and stat. Removing it may result in loss of functionality to access file status information and cause issues with the program's behavior or even lead to segmentation faults due to improper usage of system calls. Additionally, it contains several important checks such as non-null pointer validation (using __attribute__((__nonnull__(1, 2)))) and leaf function attribute (using __attribute__((__leaf__))). These checks ensure proper error handling and protection against unintended side effects or memory corruption.
