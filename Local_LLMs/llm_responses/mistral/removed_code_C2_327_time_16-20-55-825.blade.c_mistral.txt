3) The code snippet is responsible for handling the case when opening a directory fails. It sets the FTSENT structure's info and errno fields accordingly, and returns a null pointer to indicate failure. Removing this code would cause issues if a directory cannot be opened during the traversal process. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes in the program.
