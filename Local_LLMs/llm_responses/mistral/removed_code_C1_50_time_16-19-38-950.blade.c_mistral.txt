 1) Importance Score : 2
The given code snippet is a simple function named "priv_set_remove_linkdir" which returns -1. It doesn't seem to have any significant impact on the entire program.

2) Don't Remove
Removing this code might lead to undefined behavior or errors since it could be called from other parts of the codebase that rely on its functionality, even if it is not used directly in the given context.

3) Explanation:
The code snippet itself does not appear to have any security implications as it just returns -1 without performing any actions. However, since it could potentially be called from other parts of the codebase, removing it might introduce unintended consequences or errors that could impact the overall functionality and security of the program. Without further context or knowledge about how this function is being used in the larger system, it is not safe to assume that it can be removed without potential negative repercussions.
