3) The code snippet checks if the size of a variable 'dummy' is equal to the size of a void pointer, and assigns the address of the comparison function accordingly. This behavior is crucial for handling different data types, which may have different sizes, ensuring the correct functionality of the comparator in the FTS (File Tree Traversal) library. Removing it could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the program.
