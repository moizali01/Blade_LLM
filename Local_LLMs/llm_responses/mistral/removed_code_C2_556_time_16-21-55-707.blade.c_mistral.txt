3) The code snippet "fts_safe_changedir" is used multiple times within the context provided, and it seems to be responsible for changing the current working directory in a safe manner. Removing this function could lead to potential security vulnerabilities if the program relies on securely changing directories during its execution. Additionally, the functionality of the code would be impacted if this snippet was removed as it is a critical part of the file traversal algorithm used by the "fts" library.
