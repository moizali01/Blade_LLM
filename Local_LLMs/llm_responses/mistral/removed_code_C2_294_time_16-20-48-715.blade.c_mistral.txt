3) The code snippet is part of a comparison function used by the FTS (File Tree Walker) library during file traversal. It appears to be using a nested pointer dereference to call the comparison function stored in an FTSENT structure, which is likely used for sorting or filtering files based on certain criteria. Removing it could result in unexpected behavior or errors in the file traversal process.
