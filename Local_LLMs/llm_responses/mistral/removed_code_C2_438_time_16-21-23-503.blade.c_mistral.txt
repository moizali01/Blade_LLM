3) The given code snippet is assigning the memory address of a local variable 'tmp' to a pointer 'tmp___6'. It doesn't seem to have any connection with the other code snippet, as both appear to declare and initialize local variables named 'tmp'. However, removing it might cause issues if this memory location is being used elsewhere in the program. It is recommended to understand its context thoroughly before making any changes.
