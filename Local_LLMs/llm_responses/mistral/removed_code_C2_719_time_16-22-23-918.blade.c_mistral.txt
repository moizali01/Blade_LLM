3) The code snippet is part of a function `version_etc` and its variants that are used for printing version information. Removing it may break the functionality of the program when it needs to display version information. Additionally, this code does not appear to have any direct security implications, but since it interacts with the file stream `stream`, there is a potential for unintended consequences if modified or removed without proper consideration.
