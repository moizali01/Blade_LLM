3) The code snippet does not seem to have a significant impact on the entire program as it is only used for declaring pointers. However, without understanding the context of how these pointers are being used in the rest of the function and the program, it's difficult to determine if their removal could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities or functionality issues. Therefore, it's recommended to keep them to ensure the correct behavior and potential security of the code.
