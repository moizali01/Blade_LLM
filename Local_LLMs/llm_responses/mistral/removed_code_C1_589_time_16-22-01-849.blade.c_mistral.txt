3) The given code snippet `raw_hasher` is a custom hashing function used for hashing data before storing it in a hash table. Removing it may lead to unpredictable behavior or potential security vulnerabilities as the default hashing function might not provide adequate collision resistance. In addition, replacing it with an inferior or less efficient function could negatively impact the performance of the application.
