3) The code snippet, which declares a volatile variable 'exit_failure', is unrelated to the main function and appears to be used for error handling within a local scope. However, its presence might indicate that other parts of the codebase rely on this variable for error reporting or recovery. Therefore, removing it could potentially introduce unexpected behavior or make the code less robust in error situations.
