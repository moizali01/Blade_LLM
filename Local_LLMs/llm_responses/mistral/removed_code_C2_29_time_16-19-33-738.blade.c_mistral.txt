 1) Importance Score : 2
2) Don't Remove
3) The given code snippet declares local variables 'tmp', 'tmp___5', 'tmp___6', and 'tmp___7'. Since we don't have the entire context, it is difficult to assess its importance. However, assuming these variables are used within their scopes, their removal could lead to compilation errors or unintended consequences in the program. Thus, it is recommended not to remove them without further examination of the codebase.
