3) The qsort function call in the fts\_sort and fts\_alloc functions is used to sort the linked list of FTSENT structures. Removing it would result in an unsorted list, which could impact the functionality and reliability of the file traversal algorithm. Additionally, the use of qsort with a custom comparison function adds flexibility to the implementation and allows for different sorting orders. From a security perspective, the impact of removing this code is negligible since it does not involve any sensitive operations or data.
