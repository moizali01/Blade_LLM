3) The code snippet defines the structure 'stat' which is used to store file status information. Removing it would result in a compilation error and render the entire program useless, as it seems integral to the functionality of accessing and working with files in the system. Furthermore, given that the structure contains sensitive file metadata such as ownership information, removal could have significant security implications if unchecked access to this data was allowed.
