3) The code snippet `struct stat fts_statp[1];` is used to store the file status information of a file or directory during a file traversal operation using FTS library. Removing it may lead to loss of important metadata (like file type, size, access permissions etc.) during file traversal and affect the overall functionality of the program. Additionally, there may be security implications if certain permissions or ownership checks are based on this information.
