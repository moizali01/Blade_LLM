3) The given code snippet is a custom memory allocation function (xrealloc) that checks if the size of ptrdiff_t is less than or equal to the size of size_t before allocating memory. If it is, then an error is triggered using xalloc\_die(). This check ensures compatibility between different data types and prevents potential memory allocation errors. Therefore, it is important for the proper functioning and security of the program.
