3) The code snippet is a part of the 'is_empty_dir' function, which checks if a directory is empty or not. Removing it may affect the functionality of the program as it relies on this function to determine if a directory is empty before performing certain operations. Additionally, since there are no visible security concerns in this code snippet, removing it would not improve the security of the program.
