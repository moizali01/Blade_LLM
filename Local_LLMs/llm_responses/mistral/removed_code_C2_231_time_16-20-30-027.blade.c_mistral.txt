3) This code snippet is used in a recursive directory traversal function, specifically during the processing of an FTSENT (File Type Entry) structure. The purpose of this code is to store the dev and ino (device and inode number respectively) of the current file entry into an obj object for later use, such as deleting duplicate entries from an hash table. Removing it may cause unexpected behavior in the directory traversal process and potentially introduce security vulnerabilities due to improper handling of file system objects.
