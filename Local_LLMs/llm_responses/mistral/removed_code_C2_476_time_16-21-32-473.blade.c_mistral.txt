The given code snippet is a part of an FTS (File Treewalking System) implementation, where it appears to be checking the write permission for the current directory and files before performing certain operations. This check is crucial in ensuring that only authorized actions are taken, thereby improving the security of the application.

2) Don't Remove
Given the context provided, it would not be advisable to remove this code snippet as it plays a significant role in validating user permissions for file and directory operations within the application. Removing it could potentially introduce vulnerabilities and weaken the overall security of the program.

3) Explanation: The code snippet checks the write permission for the current working directory and files, preventing unauthorized write access to critical system directories or sensitive files. If removed, an attacker might be able to manipulate or modify important data within the application, leading to potential security risks and potentially compromising the entire system.
