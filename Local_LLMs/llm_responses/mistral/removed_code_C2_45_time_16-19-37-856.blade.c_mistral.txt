3) The code snippet __attribute__((__noreturn__)) void usage(int status); is used as the function prototype for the "usage" function, which seems to be handling error cases or exiting the program based on an input status. Removing it could potentially lead to unintended behavior or unexpected program termination without proper error handling or notification. Furthermore, some tools and compilers might rely on this attribute for specific optimizations, which could impact overall performance or compatibility.
