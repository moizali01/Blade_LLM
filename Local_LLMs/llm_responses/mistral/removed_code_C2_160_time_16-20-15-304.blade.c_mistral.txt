2) Don't Remove
3) The code snippet is a part of a larger function that checks if a file or directory can be removed based on certain conditions. Removing it might lead to security vulnerabilities as the function would not check if trying to remove a write-protected directory is allowed, potentially allowing unintended directory traversal or modification. Additionally, the functionality of the program could be affected as removing this check could allow users to bypass intended access controls.
