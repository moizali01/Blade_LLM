3) The code snippet `is_empty_dir()` is used to check if a given directory is empty. It's an important functionality for some operations like deleting or moving files, as we don't want to delete or move files inside non-empty directories accidentally. Additionally, it can help in optimizing some I/O operations by skipping empty directories when traversing the file system.
