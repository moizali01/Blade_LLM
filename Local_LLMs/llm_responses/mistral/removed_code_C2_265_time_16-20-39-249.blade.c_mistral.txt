3) The code snippet is responsible for dynamically allocating memory for the file name path during a file traversal operation (fts - File Tree Walker). Removing it would result in a memory leak and potential segmentation fault, causing the entire program to fail. Furthermore, it also affects the security of the application as the dynamic allocation without proper bounds checking could potentially lead to a buffer overflow vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate the input provided for file traversal.
