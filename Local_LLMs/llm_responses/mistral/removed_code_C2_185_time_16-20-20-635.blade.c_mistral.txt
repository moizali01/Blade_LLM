Response from mistral:
 1) Importance Score : 1
This code snippet does not seem to have a significant impact on the generality, functionality or security of the entire program as it is only declaring three variables with no apparent usage or interaction with other parts of the code.

2) Do not Remove
Removing this code without understanding its purpose in the context of the entire program could potentially lead to unintended consequences, especially if it was part of a larger function or structure that relies on these variables.

3) The variables declared in this snippet may be used elsewhere in the code for temporary storage or calculation purposes. Without further context, it's impossible to determine if they are still in use or not, so caution is advised before removing them.
