3) The code snippet declared two variables with the same name "tmp" and assigned pointers to them. However, this does not seem to have any functional impact as they are not used together in any way. But removing it could potentially lead to compiler warnings if the same variable name is used elsewhere in the code with different meaning. From a security perspective, there seems to be no implication since the variables are not involved in handling user inputs or sensitive data.
