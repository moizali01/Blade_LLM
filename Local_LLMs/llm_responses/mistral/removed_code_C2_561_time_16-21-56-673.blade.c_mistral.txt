3) The `fts_load` function appears to be a part of the File Tree Walker (FTS) library, which is used for traversing directories and files in a hierarchical manner. Removing this function would likely cause issues with the overall functionality of the FTS library and may result in unexpected behavior when attempting to traverse file trees. Additionally, as this code snippet deals with managing pointers and memory allocation within the FTS data structures, its removal could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities if not replaced with a suitable alternative.
