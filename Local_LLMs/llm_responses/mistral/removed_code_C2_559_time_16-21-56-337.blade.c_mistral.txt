3) The `fts_padjust` function is responsible for adjusting the size of a dynamic buffer used by the FTS (File Tree Walker) library. This library is used to traverse directories and files in a hierarchical manner, which is a common functionality in many Unix-based systems and applications. Without this code, the FTS library may not be able to handle paths with varying lengths and could result in buffer overflows or memory leaks.

Removing this function would have significant implications on the generality, functionality, and security of the application relying on the FTS library.
