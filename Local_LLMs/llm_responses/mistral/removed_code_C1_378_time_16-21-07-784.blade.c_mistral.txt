3) The code snippet appears to be setting the value of 'p->fts_info' based on the return value of a function call (fts_stat). It's not clear what this function does or how it relates to the rest of the code without additional context. However, since it's modifying a variable used in other parts of the code, removing it could potentially introduce bugs or unintended behavior.
