3) The code snippet `static char const *file_name;` is used as a file name variable in the function `write_protected_non_symlink()`. It's not directly related to the quotation functions (quote, quote_n, set_program_name), but it might be important for the proper functioning of this specific function. Removing it could cause issues with the file handling operations in the code.
