2) Don't Remove
3) This code snippet appears to be a local variable declaration and assignment within the scope of a function. Removing it could lead to undefined behavior, as the memory allocated to 'tmp___6' would not be properly released. It is also possible that this variable is used elsewhere in the function or called function, so removing it could have unintended consequences on functionality. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine if this code has any security implications, but it does not appear to be directly related to security.
