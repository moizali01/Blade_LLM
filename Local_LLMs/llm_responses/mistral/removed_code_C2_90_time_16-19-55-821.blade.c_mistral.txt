3) The code snippet is part of a larger context that appears to be using the FTS (File Tree Scanning) library for traversing directories and performing various operations on files. Removing it could potentially disrupt the proper functioning of this directory traversal and file manipulation logic, leading to unexpected behavior or errors in the program. Additionally, without the full context of the codebase, it's impossible to determine if the removed snippet may be necessary for handling specific edge cases or security considerations.
