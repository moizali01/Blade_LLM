3) The given code snippet is a local variable declaration with the same name "tmp" being repeated multiple times. This doesn't have any significant importance to the entire program's generality, functionality or security as they are just local variables and their scope is limited. However, it might cause potential issues such as name collision if these variables are used differently in different parts of the code. It is generally a good coding practice to avoid using the same variable names multiple times in the same context. But from a security standpoint, this snippet doesn't seem to be harmful, and its removal won't impact the overall system security.
