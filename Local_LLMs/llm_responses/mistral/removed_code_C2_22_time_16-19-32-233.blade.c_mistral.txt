3) The given code snippet does not seem to have a significant impact on the generality, functionality or security of the program as it appears to only declare and initialize some local variables. However, without additional context it is impossible to determine for certain if these variables are being used elsewhere in the code. Therefore, it is best practice to err on the side of caution and not remove this code until its role has been fully understood.
