3) The code snippet `triple_free(void *x)` is responsible for freeing the memory allocated to a structure of type `struct F_triple`. Given that there are other parts of the code which allocate such structures, this function plays an essential role in managing memory and preventing leaks.

3) The hash function `hash_pjw` seems unrelated to the provided code snippet for `triple_free`. It is a separate piece of functionality that appears to be used in a different part of the code. However, based on its name (pjw stands for Peter J. Weinberger), it looks like a well-known and widely-used hash function. Thus, it might be important for the overall program functionality as a consistent hashing method might be essential for other parts of the application.

3) The main part of the provided code is involved in comparison of two `struct F_triple` instances. It checks whether their inode and device numbers, as well as file names, are equal or not. While it may seem like an unnecessary check for some use-cases, its presence might be crucial for other parts of the application that rely on this specific comparison logic. Additionally, the code seems to be a part of a larger function, with the snippet for `triple_free` being a separate responsibility.
