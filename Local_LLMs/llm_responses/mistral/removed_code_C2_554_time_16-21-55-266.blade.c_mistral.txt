3) The `AD_hash` function is used twice in the given code snippets, once in `setup_dir` function and another in `AD_hash` function. It seems to be calculating a hash value for a `struct Active_dir` object based on its `ino` field. Removing it may result in inconsistent behavior or incorrect functioning of the `setup_dir` and `AD_hash` functions as they rely on this hash value for comparison and indexing purposes respectively.
