3) The code snippet is responsible for handling errors related to non-existent files, and it uses the fprintf function to report these errors to the standard error stream. Removing this code could potentially hide or suppress important error messages that could help in debugging or understanding issues with file operations. Additionally, removing this code could lead to undefined behavior if the function is called but the error handling is not present.
