3) This code snippet is responsible for printing the version information and authors of a package. Removing it could potentially result in the lack of transparency regarding the origin and version of used packages, which may be important for audit and traceability purposes. Additionally, it is likely that other parts of the codebase rely on this function to gather version information during runtime, leading to potential build or integration failures if removed.
