3) The 'last\_component' function is used twice in the 'file\_type' function, which is essential for determining the file type based on the given file path. Removing it would break the functionality of this module, potentially leading to incorrect file type identification or even program crashes. Additionally, since the code snippet appears to be using standard C library functions such as 'strcmp' and 'malloc', there doesn't seem to be any obvious security concerns associated with it.
