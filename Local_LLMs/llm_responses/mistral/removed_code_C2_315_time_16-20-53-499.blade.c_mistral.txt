3) The code snippet is responsible for sorting the list of files based on inode numbers when dealing with a large number of files (more than 10000). Removing it would result in an unordered listing of files, which could impact the functionality and usability of the program. Additionally, it also has potential security implications as an unsorted file listing could make it easier for attackers to locate specific files in a directory, especially if they know the filenames or have some knowledge about the expected file order.
