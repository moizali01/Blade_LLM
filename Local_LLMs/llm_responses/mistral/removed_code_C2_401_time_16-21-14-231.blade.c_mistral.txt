Response from mistral:
 1) Importance Score : 2
The given code snippet is a simple memory deallocation command, it doesn't seem to have significant impact on the entire program's generality, functionality or security.

2) Remove
The memory allocated by 'tmp' variable is being explicitly freed in this code snippet using 'free()'. If we remove this line of code, there will be a memory leak.

3) Explanation:
Removing this code snippet would lead to a memory leak as the memory allocated to 'tmp' variable would not be freed and thus consume system resources. This can impact program performance over time.
