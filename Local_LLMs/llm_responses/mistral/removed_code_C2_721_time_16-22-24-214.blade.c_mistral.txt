3) The code snippet (extern int printf(...)) is used in multiple functions for printing messages, which seems essential for proper program functionality. Its removal could potentially result in undefined behavior or errors during execution. Additionally, the impact on security appears negligible as this is a standard library function and not specific to any potentially sensitive data handling in the code snippet itself.
