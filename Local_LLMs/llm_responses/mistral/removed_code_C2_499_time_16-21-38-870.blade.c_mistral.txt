3) The code snippet `free((void *)sp->fts_path);` is responsible for freeing the memory allocated to `sp->fts_path`. If this line is removed, there will be a memory leak as `sp->fts_path` will not be freed when `fts_treewalk()` function is done. This can lead to wasting system resources and potential security vulnerabilities due to dangling pointers.
