3) This code snippet is responsible for checking if the current file being processed is a symbolic link and if so, following it. It is an essential part of the functionality provided by the FTS (File Tree Walker) utility as described in the context. Removing it would cause the program to not correctly identify and process symbolic links during a directory traversal. In terms of security implications, this code snippet does not introduce any vulnerabilities on its own. However, it could potentially interact with other parts of the code that may have security weaknesses. Therefore, it is important that any potential security risks in the rest of the codebase are addressed first before considering the removal of this specific code snippet.
