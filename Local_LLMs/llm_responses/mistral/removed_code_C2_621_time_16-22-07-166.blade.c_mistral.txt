3) The code snippet `extern char *program_invocation_short_name;` is used to define a variable that stores the short name of the program. This variable is later assigned the value of the base name of the argv[0] argument passed to the function set\_program\_name(). Removing this code may lead to loss of functionality as other parts of the program may rely on this variable to identify and access the short name of the program. Additionally, removing this code may have security implications if the program uses the short name for access control or other purposes related to file or directory permissions.
