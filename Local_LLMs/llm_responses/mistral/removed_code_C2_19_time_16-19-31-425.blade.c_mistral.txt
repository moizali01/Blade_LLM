3) The given code snippet does not seem to have any significant impact on the program's generality, functionality or security as it only declares a pointer variable named tmp___6 which is used elsewhere in the code. Removing it may result in compiler errors or unexpected behavior if the memory allocated to tmp___6 is still being referenced elsewhere in the code.
