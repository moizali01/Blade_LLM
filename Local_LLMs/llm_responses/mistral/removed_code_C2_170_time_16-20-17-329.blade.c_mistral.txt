3) This code snippet is important as it appears to handle directory traversal during a file tree walk operation. It ensures that the current directory is properly changed or advanced between directories, allowing for correct traversal of the file tree. Removing this could result in incorrect file traversal or even potential security vulnerabilities if the file tree contains sensitive files or directories.
