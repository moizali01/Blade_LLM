3) The given code snippet is just declaring a variable named 'tmp___20', which seems irrelevant without context of the surrounding code. However, removing it may lead to undefined behavior or errors if the variable is being used elsewhere in the codebase. It's important to understand the role and usage of this variable before making any decision.
