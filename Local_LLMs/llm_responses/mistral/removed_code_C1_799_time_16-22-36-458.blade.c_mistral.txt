3) The code snippet `close_stdin()` is part of the `close_*()` functions that are used to close standard input, output, and error streams. Removing it could lead to resource leaks or unexpected behavior when these streams are no longer needed. Additionally, the code appears to include error handling for potential write errors, which is important for ensuring proper program termination and reporting of issues.
