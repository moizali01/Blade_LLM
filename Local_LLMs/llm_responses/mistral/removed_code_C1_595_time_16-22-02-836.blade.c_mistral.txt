3) The `rotr_sz` function is used only once in the provided code snippet, specifically when dealing with a hash table. Its removal might lead to potential issues if another part of the program relies on this function for its intended functionality or security. The function seems to be performing a bitwise rotation operation, which could have implications for data processing and integrity within the hash table.
