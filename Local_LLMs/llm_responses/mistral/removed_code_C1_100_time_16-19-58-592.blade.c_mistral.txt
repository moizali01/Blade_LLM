3) The given code snippet is a part of a switch statement that determines the file type based on the 'fts_info' value. Removing it may cause unexpected behavior or even break the functionality of the program as other parts of the code depend on this switch statement to identify and process files accordingly. Moreover, the security implications could be significant since some of the cases in the switch statement handle error checking and file removal. Thus, removing this code without a thorough understanding of its role within the larger context of the program could introduce vulnerabilities or unintended consequences.
