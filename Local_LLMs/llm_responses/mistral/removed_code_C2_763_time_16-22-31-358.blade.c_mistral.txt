3) The code snippet is part of a function `is_empty_dir` which checks if a directory is empty or not. It uses the readdir() function to read the directory entries, and it is called in other parts of the code. Removing this code could result in incorrect functionality of those parts of the program that rely on checking whether directories are empty. Additionally, since there does not seem to be any obvious security implications with using readdir(), removing it would not provide any significant security benefit.
