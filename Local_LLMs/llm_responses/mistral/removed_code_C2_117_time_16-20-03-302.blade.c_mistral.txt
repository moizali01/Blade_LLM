Response from mistral:
 1) Importance Score : 2
The given code snippet does not appear to have a significant impact on the generality, functionality or security of the entire program as it only declares pointers and is used multiple times with different names.

2) Remove
The code snippet can be safely removed as it only declares variables and does not contain any logic or functionality that is essential for the proper functioning of the program.

3) Explanation:
Removing this code snippet will not affect the overall behavior or security of the program since it solely declares pointers without performing any operations on them. However, it's always important to ensure that such changes do not cause unintended side effects in other parts of the codebase. Therefore, thorough testing and code review should be performed before making this change.
