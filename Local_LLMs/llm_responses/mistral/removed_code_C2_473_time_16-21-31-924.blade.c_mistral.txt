3) The code snippet is responsible for freeing the memory allocated for an FTSENT structure when that structure is no longer needed. If removed, there would be a memory leak, leading to potential security vulnerabilities and increased resource usage over time. Additionally, it affects the functionality of the entire file traversal operation as each FTSENT structure must be freed properly for proper program behavior.
