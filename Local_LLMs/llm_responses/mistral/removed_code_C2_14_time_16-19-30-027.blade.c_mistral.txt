3) The `set_program_name` function appears to be responsible for setting the program name based on the first argument passed to the program. Removing this specific code snippet would result in an undefined behavior since `program_name` is initialized to null pointer. This could potentially lead to security vulnerabilities or incorrect functionality if the program relies on having a valid program name set correctly.
