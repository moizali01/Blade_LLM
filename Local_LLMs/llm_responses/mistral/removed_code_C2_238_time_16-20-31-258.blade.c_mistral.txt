3) The code snippet is related to changing the current working directory (CWD) during a file traversal operation using the fts library. Removing it may lead to unexpected behavior or even security vulnerabilities if the CWD is not properly managed, especially when dealing with paths provided by untrusted sources. Properly managing the CWD is an essential aspect of any file traversal function to prevent potential security issues such as directory traversal attacks (e.g., "../" attack).
