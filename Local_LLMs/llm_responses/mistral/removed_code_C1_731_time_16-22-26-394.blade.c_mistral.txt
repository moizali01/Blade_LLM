3) The code snippet is part of an error handling mechanism for the "xfts\_open" function, which attempts to open a file using the "fts\_open" function. If the opening fails with error code EACCES (access denied), the code checks if the user has permission to write in the directory by trying to open the "." symbol. If it fails again, the program will exit with an error message. This mechanism is essential for ensuring the correct functionality and security of the program, as it prevents further execution when encountering access errors that could lead to unintended consequences or data corruption.
