3) The code snippet `FTSENT *p;` is simply declaring a pointer variable named 'p' of type FTSENT. It does not seem to have any significant role in the given context as it is declared twice with no apparent usage. Since it doesn't affect the generality, functionality or security of the program, it can be safely removed.
