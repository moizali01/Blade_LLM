3) The given code snippets declare three variables named "tmp" with different data types - an integer and two pointers to integers. Removing any of these declarations could lead to undesired behavior in the program due to potential uninitialized or unused variables. Additionally, since the exact context of these variables is not provided, it is impossible to determine if they are being used elsewhere in the codebase. Therefore, it is recommended to keep all declared variables for proper functionality and security of the code.
