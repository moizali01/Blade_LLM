2) Don't Remove
3) The given code snippet doesn't seem to have any meaningful impact on the entire program as it only declares three local variables. However, without seeing the context in which this code appears or understanding the purpose of these variables, it is not possible to definitively say that they cannot be removed. It may be worth investigating further to ensure that their removal would not negatively impact the functionality of the program.
