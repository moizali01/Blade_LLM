3) This code is responsible for removing files and directories during the file tree traversal. It follows the standard unlinkat() system call and checks for errors, such as "Permission denied" or "Is a directory". If an error occurs, it sets the errno variable and tries to remove the entry recursively. Since this code is essential for proper file removal, it should not be removed.
