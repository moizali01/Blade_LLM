Response from mistral:
 1) Importance Score : 2
The code snippet defines three variables of type int, but the last two are redundant since they have the same name "tmp" as a local variable declared right before it. This has no significant impact on the generality, functionality, or security of the entire program.

2) Remove
Removing this code will only eliminate the redundancy and does not pose any security risk nor affect the functionality of the program.

3) Explanation:
By removing the second and third occurrences of the variable "tmp," we are merely optimizing the code by reducing unnecessary declarations. This has no impact on the security or functionality of the program, as both instances refer to the same local variable.
