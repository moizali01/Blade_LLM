3) The `fts_sort` function is used to sort an array of FTSENT pointers, which is a crucial functionality for the proper operation of the File Tree Walker (FTS) library. Removing it would prevent the library from being able to sort the file entries in various ways, depending on user requirements.

Additionally, the code snippet in question appears to use a comparison function `(*((*(pa + 0))->fts_fts)->fts_compar))` that is likely specific to the FTS library's implementation and usage context. Changing or removing it could lead to unintended behavior or even potential security vulnerabilities if the sorting order does not properly handle certain file entries or edge cases.
