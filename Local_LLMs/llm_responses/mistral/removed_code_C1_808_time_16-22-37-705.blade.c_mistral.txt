 1) Importance Score : 8
This function is important as it properly closes standard input, output, and error streams which can help prevent potential issues such as resource leaks or unwanted input. It also includes error handling and logging, which aids in debugging and maintaining the integrity of the program.

2) Don't Remove
Removing this function could lead to unintended consequences such as resource leaks, incorrect program behavior, and security vulnerabilities.

3) The removal of this code snippet may result in open file descriptors not being closed properly which can cause issues with the proper functioning of the program or even potential security vulnerabilities if an attacker is able to write to these streams. Additionally, error handling and logging are important for debugging and maintaining the integrity of the program, so their removal could negatively impact the application's reliability.
