3) The `hash_pjw` function appears to be used for hashing strings and comparing file stat information, which seems crucial for the functionality of the rest of the code. Since it is used within the `triple_hash` function, removing it could potentially break the hash table implementation or cause incorrect comparisons when looking up entries in the table.
