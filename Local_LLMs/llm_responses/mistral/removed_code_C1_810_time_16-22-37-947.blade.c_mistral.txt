3) The code snippet is responsible for handling errors related to file removal operations, specifically those related to non-existent files. Removing it could potentially cause the program to fail to handle these types of errors properly and potentially lead to security vulnerabilities or functional issues if not handled correctly. Additionally, it appears to be used in conjunction with the "fts" library for handling file traversal, which is a critical functionality of the program.
