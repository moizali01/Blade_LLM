3) The code snippet `triple_compare_ino_str` is used in the hash function `triple_hash` to create a unique key for an entry in a hash table. Removing it would cause the hash table to lose its ability to uniquely identify entries, leading to potential collisions and data loss. Additionally, since this code also checks if two file structures have the same inode number and filename, removing it could potentially allow for security vulnerabilities by allowing duplicate files with different names but identical content to be stored in the hash table.
