3) The code snippet `triple_hash` is used to calculate an index for a hash table based on the name and inode number of a file. Removing it would cause issues with how data is stored and accessed in the program, as this function seems essential for maintaining the integrity of the data structure. Additionally, since the code snippet `triple_compare_ino_str` also relies on the `hash_pjw` function, removing it could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities due to incorrect handling or comparison of file names and inode numbers.
