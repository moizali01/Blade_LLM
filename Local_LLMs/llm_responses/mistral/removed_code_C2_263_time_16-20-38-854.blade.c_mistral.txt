2) Do not Remove
3) The code snippet is part of the file traversal process in a recursive directory traversal function. Removing it could lead to incorrect path construction, potentially causing the program to fail or behave unexpectedly during file traversal operations. Additionally, since this code is being used in conjunction with other security flags (sp->fts_options), removing it without understanding its role within the larger context of the program could have unintended security implications.
