3) The given code snippet is used to set the value of 'program_name' and 'program_invocation_name' variables based on the program name passed as an argument. These variables are likely being used throughout the codebase, so removing this code may lead to undefined behavior or errors in the program. Additionally, the use of 'extern' keyword indicates that these variables might be shared with other parts of the application, making their removal potentially risky.
