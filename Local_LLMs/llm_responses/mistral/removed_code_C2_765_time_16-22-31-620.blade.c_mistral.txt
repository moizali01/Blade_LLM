3) The code snippet is part of the string comparison functions and is used throughout the program. It has no security implications as it is a pure function, meaning it does not modify any external state or data. Therefore, removing it could result in compiler errors or functional issues if similar functionality is not properly implemented elsewhere in the codebase.
