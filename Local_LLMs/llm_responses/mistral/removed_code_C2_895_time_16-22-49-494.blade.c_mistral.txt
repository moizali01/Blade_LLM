3) The code snippet `ignorable_missing()` is used by other functions (`fts_skip_tree()`, `mark_ancestor_dirs()`) in the context provided to check if an error number corresponds to a missing file. Removing it may result in unexpected behavior when handling file errors and potential security vulnerabilities, as ignoring some file errors might allow unintended access or modification of files.
