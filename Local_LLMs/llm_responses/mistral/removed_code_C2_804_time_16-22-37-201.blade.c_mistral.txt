3) The 'close_stream' function is used within the 'close_stdout' function, which seems to be handling standard output streams. Removing it might lead to potential memory leaks or resource mismanagement if files are not properly closed after use. Additionally, there might be other parts of the codebase that rely on this function for proper file management.
