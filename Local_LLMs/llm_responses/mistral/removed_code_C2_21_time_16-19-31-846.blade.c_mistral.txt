3) The given code snippet declares three variables, two of which are pointers to integers and one is an integer. Its impact on the entire program's generality, functionality, and security seems minimal as it doesn't contain any observable logic or interaction with other parts of the code provided in the context. However, its removal might lead to compiler errors if these variables are used elsewhere in the code.
