2) Remove
3) This code snippet checks if the fts_info value of the FTSENT structure is either 6 or 4, and sets tmp___16 accordingly. However, since tmp___16 is not used anywhere else in the program, removing this code will not affect the overall generality, functionality, or security of the program.
