 Answer is:

1) Importance Score: 5
2) Don't Remove
3) This code snippet checks if the pointer 'p' is equal to NULL and returns NULL if it is. Removing this code could lead to a potential segmentation fault or undefined behavior if 'p' is used further in the program. Therefore, it is important to keep this code for the program's functionality and security.
