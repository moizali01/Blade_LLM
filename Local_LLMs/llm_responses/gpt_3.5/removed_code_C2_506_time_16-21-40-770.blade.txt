 Answer is:

1) Importance Score: 5
2) Remove
3) This line of code sets the fts_info field of the fts_cur structure to 9. It is not clear from the provided code snippet what the significance of this field is or how it is used in the program. Therefore, it is safe to remove this line of code as it does not seem to have a significant impact on the generality, functionality, or security of the program.
