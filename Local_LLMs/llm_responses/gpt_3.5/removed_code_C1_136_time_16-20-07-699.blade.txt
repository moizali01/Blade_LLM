3) This code snippet checks if the value of `*tmp___8` is equal to 30. If it is, it calls `lstatat` function to check the status of the file/directory specified by `ent->fts_accpath`. If `lstatat` fails and the error code is not 2, it sets the value of `*tmp___5` to 30. However, this code does not seem to have a significant impact on the overall generality, functionality, and security of the program. Therefore, it can be removed without major implications.
