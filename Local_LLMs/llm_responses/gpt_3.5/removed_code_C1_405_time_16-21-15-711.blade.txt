3) This code snippet is responsible for handling the case when p->fts_info is equal to 1. It checks if instr is equal to 4 and if sp->fts_options & 64 is true. If both conditions are true, it checks if p->fts_statp[0].st_dev is not equal to sp->fts_dev. If this condition is true, it closes p->fts_symfd and frees sp->fts_child. Then it sets p->fts_info to 6 and calls leave_dir(sp, p). Removing this code snippet may affect the functionality and security of the program as it handles specific cases related to p->fts_info.
