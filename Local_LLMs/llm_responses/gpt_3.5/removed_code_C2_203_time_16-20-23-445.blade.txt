 Answer is:

1) Importance Score: 5
2) Do not Remove
3) The code snippet declares a pointer variable "filename" of type "char const". It is difficult to determine the exact importance of this code without further context. However, removing it may potentially affect the program's functionality if the variable is used elsewhere in the program. Therefore, it is recommended not to remove it unless its usage and impact on the program are thoroughly understood.
