 Answer is:

1) Importance Score: 8
2) Don't Remove
3) This code snippet is important for the functionality and security of the program. It checks if the size of the file is -1, indicating that the size has not been determined yet. If so, it calls the fstatat function to get the file size. If the fstatat function fails, it sets the size to -2 and stores the error code in st_ino. This information is crucial for further operations in the program and removing this code could lead to incorrect file size calculations and potential security vulnerabilities.
