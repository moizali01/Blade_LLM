2) Remove
3) This code snippet is responsible for adjusting the fts_name field of the FTSENT structure. It checks if cp is not null and if it is not equal to p->fts_name. If both conditions are true, it updates the fts_name field by copying the contents of cp to p->fts_name. However, this code snippet does not seem to have a significant impact on the overall generality, functionality, and security of the program. Therefore, it can be removed without major implications.
