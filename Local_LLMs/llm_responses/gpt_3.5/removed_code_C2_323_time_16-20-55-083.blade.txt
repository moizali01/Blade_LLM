Candidate set exist in coverage?:

True

 Candidate set determined based on line:

if ((int)*(cur->fts_path + (cur->fts_pathlen - 1UL)) == 47) {

 Answer is:

1) Importance Score: 5
2) Remove
3) This code snippet checks if the last character of the fts_path is a forward slash ("/"). If it is, it sets the len variable to cur->fts_pathlen - 1, otherwise it sets len to cur->fts_pathlen. Removing this code snippet would not have a significant impact on the overall generality, functionality, and security of the program.
