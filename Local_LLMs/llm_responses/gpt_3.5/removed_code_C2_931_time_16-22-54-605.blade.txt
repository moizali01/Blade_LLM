 Answer is:

1) Importance Score: 5
2) Remove
3) This code snippet declares a variable "fts_nitems" of type "size_t". It is difficult to determine the exact importance of this variable without understanding its usage in the rest of the program. However, if it is not used anywhere else, removing it should not have a significant impact on the generality, functionality, and security of the program.
