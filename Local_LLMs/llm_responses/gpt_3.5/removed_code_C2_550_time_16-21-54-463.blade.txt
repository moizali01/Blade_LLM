 Answer is:

1) Importance Score: 7
2) Remove
3) This code snippet is responsible for freeing resources used by the FTS structure. If the FTS structure has the fts_options flag set to 258, it frees the hash table (sp->fts_cycle.ht). Otherwise, it frees the state structure (sp->fts_cycle.state). Removing this code could lead to memory leaks and potential resource issues, so it should not be removed.
