 Answer is:

1) Importance Score: 5
2) Remove
3) This code snippet checks if the pointer 'p' is equal to NULL and if so, frees the memory allocated for 'sp->fts_path' and returns false. Removing this code snippet would not have a significant impact on the generality, functionality, or security of the program as it is a simple check for a NULL pointer and memory deallocation.
