 Candidate set determined based on line:

_Bool nostat;

 Answer is:

1) Importance Score: 5
2) Don't Remove
3) The code snippet defines a global variable "nostat" of type "_Bool". It is difficult to determine the exact importance of this variable without further context. However, since it is a global variable, it may be used in other parts of the program and removing it could potentially affect the functionality of the program. Therefore, it is recommended not to remove it without a thorough understanding of its usage.
