3) The code snippet `__inline static _Bool is_zero_or_power_of_two(uintmax_t i) { return ((_Bool)((i & (i - 1UL)) == 0UL)); }` appears to be a helper function for checking if an integer is zero or a power of two. This functionality is crucial in the context of cycle detection, and removing it could potentially break the entire program's security and functionality.
