3) The code snippet is part of the rm() function's error handling and assertion mechanism. It checks if the status returned by the rm() function matches certain expected values (RM_OK, RM_USER_DECLINED, or RM_ERROR). If not, it triggers an assertion failure. Removing this code could potentially hide errors or unexpected behavior in the program, making it harder to debug and maintain.
