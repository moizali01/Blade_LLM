3) The code snippet `triple_free` is responsible for freeing the memory allocated to a structure of type `struct F_triple`. If this code is removed, memory leaks may occur, which can lead to resource exhaustion and potential security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the function `hash_pjw` appears to use structures of type `struct F_triple` in its implementation, so removing `triple_free` could potentially result in undefined behavior or errors in this function.
