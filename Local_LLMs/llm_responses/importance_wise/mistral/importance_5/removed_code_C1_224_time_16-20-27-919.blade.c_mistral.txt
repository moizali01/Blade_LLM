3) The 'fseeko' function call is used in the definition of the 'rpl_fseeko' function, which seems to be a custom implementation of an fseek-like function. Its removal could potentially break functionality related to file positioning in streams handled by this function. It does not appear to pose any immediate security risks as it is an externally defined library function and its usage is confined within the local context of the code snippet provided.
