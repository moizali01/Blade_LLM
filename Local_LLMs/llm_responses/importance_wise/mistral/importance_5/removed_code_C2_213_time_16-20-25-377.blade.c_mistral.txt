3) The `dot_or_dotdot` function is used to check if a given file name starts with "." or "..". It is being used in the `readdir_ignoring_dot_and_dotdot` function which seems to be used for reading directories while ignoring files named "." and "..". Removing this code could cause issues with the proper functioning of the directory traversal operation.
