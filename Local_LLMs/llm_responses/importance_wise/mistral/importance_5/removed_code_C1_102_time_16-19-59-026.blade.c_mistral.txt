3) This code snippet is used as a part of a switch statement for handling different file types during the file traversal process. Removing it may lead to unexpected behavior or even crashes, especially if new file types are added in the future without updating the switch statement accordingly. Additionally, there might be security implications since the function seems to be removing files based on their type information.
