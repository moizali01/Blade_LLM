3) The `cache_stat_init` function is used to initialize the `struct stat` variable with an uninitialized value. Removing it could result in undefined behavior when trying to access the `st` variable before initialization. This could potentially introduce security vulnerabilities or functionality issues depending on how the rest of the codebase relies on this variable.
