3) The code snippet declared the function opendir() with the MISRA C rule compliance attribute nonnull(1), which ensures that the argument name is not a null pointer. In the context provided, there are two functions opendir\_safer() and is\_empty\_dir() using this function with a checked argument. Removing this code snippet may lead to undefined behavior or runtime errors if these functions are called with a null pointer argument. The importance score is relatively low because the code does not seem to have a significant impact on the program's generality, functionality, and security as it is merely an attribute for input validation.
