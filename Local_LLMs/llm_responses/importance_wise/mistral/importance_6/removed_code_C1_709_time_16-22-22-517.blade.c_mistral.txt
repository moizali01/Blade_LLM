3) The `strip_trailing_slashes` function is used in multiple places throughout the code, including when determining the base name of a file. Removing it could potentially introduce bugs related to handling file paths with trailing slashes. Additionally, since this function is also used in some security checks (e.g., `open_safer`), removing it could negatively impact the security of the program.
