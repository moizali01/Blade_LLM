**Required Functionality**:

Functionality: The tar utility is used only with the -cf flag to archive all types of files, directories, and nested structures, preserving data integrity within the archive.
Purpose:  This task requires the functionality to create archives using the -cf flag, allowing the inclusion of files, folders, and directories (including nested directories) with varying extensions.

**Unrequired Functionality (to be removed):**

1. **Decompression:** Any decompression functionality such as the -xf option can be safely removed.
2. **Appending and Updating:** Remove `-A`, `-r`, `-u` for appending files to an archive.
3. Any Verbose Functionality.
4. Anything other than compression.
