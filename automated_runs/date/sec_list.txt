- **Input validation:**  Test the program's handling of invalid input, including malformed file paths, invalid user/group names, and incorrect numeric values.
- **Sanitization of user input:**  Verify that the program properly sanitizes user input to prevent malicious code injection.
- **Resource exhaustion:**  Test the program's behavior when encountering resource limitations, such as memory exhaustion or open file limits.
- **Buffer overflows:**  Test for potential buffer overflows in the program's input handling and string manipulation functions.
- **Error Handling:** Ensure the program handles all error conditions gracefully to handle robustness.
