- **Race Conditions:** Prevent concurrent access to shared resources like temporary files, ensuring thread safety and avoiding unexpected behavior due to timing issues.
- **File locking:** Ensure the program can handle or gracefully fail when attempting to access files that are locked by other processes.
- **Buffer Overflow:** Protect against memory corruption and potential security vulnerabilities by properly handling extremely long lines or large input files.
- **File System Errors:** Gracefully handle situations involving invalid file paths, non-existent files, or files with restricted permissions to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior.
- **Input Validation:** Guard against malformed or malicious input by properly validating and sanitizing data before processing.
- **Output Validation:** Ensure the correctness and consistency of the program's output to maintain data integrity and prevent errors in downstream processes.
- **Corner cases:** Handle special file names like ".", "..", or empty strings correctly to avoid unexpected behavior or security issues.
- **Resource cleanup:** Prevent resource leaks by ensuring proper cleanup of file descriptors, memory, and other resources after operations complete.
- **Signal Handling:** Implement proper handling of signals like SIGINT, SIGTERM, or SIGSEGV to ensure graceful termination and cleanup when interrupted.
- **File System Permissions:** Handle situations where the program lacks necessary permissions to create or modify files in certain directories, preventing unexpected crashes or data loss.
- **Memory Corruption:** Protect against vulnerabilities that could lead to memory corruption through invalid memory access or pointer manipulation.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure that the program's operations do not introduce errors or data corruption, maintaining the integrity of the processed data.
