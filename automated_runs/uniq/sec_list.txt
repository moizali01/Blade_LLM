Input Validation: The program parses command-line arguments and input files. Ensure that the program properly validates input to prevent potential buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or other injection attacks.
Command Injection: If the program uses functions like execlp() to execute external commands, ensure that it properly sanitizes input to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
Memory Management: The program uses dynamic memory allocation. Ensure that the program correctly allocates and frees memory to prevent memory leaks or dangling pointers.
Environment Variables: The program may use environment variables. Ensure that the program does not rely on potentially insecure environment variables or allow attackers to manipulate them.
Buffer Overflow: The program uses buffers for storing data. Ensure that the program does not overflow these buffers to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
Data Integrity: The program performs data transformations and comparisons. Ensure that the program maintains data integrity and does not introduce vulnerabilities that could lead to data corruption or manipulation.
Format String Vulnerability: The program uses format strings for printing output. Ensure that the program does not use format strings in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities.
Resource Exhaustion: The program can potentially exhaust system resources like memory, file descriptors, or CPU time, especially when dealing with large input files.
File Descriptor Limits: The program uses file descriptors for input and output streams. Exceeding the system's file descriptor limit can lead to errors.
Locale Settings: The program's behavior can be influenced by locale settings. Ensure that the program handles different locale settings correctly and does not exhibit unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities due to locale-specific data.
File System Access: The program accesses files and directories. Ensure that the program has appropriate permissions to access these files and directories and that the program does not expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access.
Process Management: If the program creates and manages child processes for certain operations, ensure that it correctly handles process creation, termination, and communication to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
Integer Overflow: The program performs arithmetic operations on integers. Ensure that the program handles potential integer overflows to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
