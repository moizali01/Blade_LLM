Query:

goto case_2;


LLM Response:

Class 1: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience. The code is a jump statement and does not directly contribute to the compression functionality.
Class 2: This code may be needed for minor issues but does not affect overall functionality. The code is a jump statement and does not directly contribute to the compression functionality.
Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. The code is a jump statement and is part of the switch-case structure that determines the input and output file handling based on the `srcMode` variable. This structure is essential for the program's workflow and functionality.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. The code is a jump statement and is part of the switch-case structure that determines the input and output file handling based on the `srcMode` variable. This structure is essential for the program's workflow and functionality.

Explanation: The code snippet is a jump statement within a switch-case structure. This structure is crucial for determining the input and output file handling based on the `srcMode` variable. Removing this jump statement would disrupt the program's workflow and potentially lead to incorrect file handling, affecting the compression functionality.

Final Verdict: Class 3 (3)
