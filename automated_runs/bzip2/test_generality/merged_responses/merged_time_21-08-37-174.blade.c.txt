Explanation: The code snippet `license();` is part of a switch statement that handles command-line arguments. This specific case (`case_86` and `case_76`) is responsible for displaying the license information. Since we are not interested in any kind of help information, this code is not needed for our required functionality.

Final Verdict: Class 1 (1)
