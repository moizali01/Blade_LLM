Class 1: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience. The code is only used to display an error message, which is not part of the required functionality.
Class 2: This code may be needed for minor issues but does not affect overall functionality. The code is used to display an error message, which is not essential for the compression functionality.
Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. The code is used to display an error message, which is necessary to inform the user about potential issues during the compression process.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. The code is not critical for the functionality of the program. It is only used to display an error message, which is not essential for the compression process.

Explanation: The code snippet is used to display an error message to the user if the output file cannot be created. While this is helpful for debugging and user experience, it is not essential for the core compression functionality. The program can still function without this error message.

Final Verdict: Class 3 (3)
