LLM Response:

Class 1: This code is not directly related to the compression algorithm or file handling.
Class 2: This code is not essential for the basic compression functionality.
Class 3: This code is not directly involved in the compression process.
Class 4: This code is not critical for the core compression functionality.

Explanation: The code snippet defines a function `mySignalCatcher` that handles signals like Control-C. While signal handling is important for program stability, it's not directly related to the compression algorithm or file handling. The code snippet is responsible for gracefully exiting the program upon receiving a signal, which is a general program behavior and not specific to the compression functionality.

Final Verdict: Class 2 (Somewhat Unnecessary Code)
