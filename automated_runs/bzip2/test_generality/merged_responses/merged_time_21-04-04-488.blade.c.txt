LLM Response:

Class 1: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience as it is only relevant for decompression.
Class 2: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience as it is only relevant for decompression.
Class 3: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience as it is only relevant for decompression.
Class 4: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience as it is only relevant for decompression.

Explanation: The code snippet is part of a conditional block that checks for the `srcMode` flag, which is related to decompression functionality. Since we are only interested in compression functionality, this code snippet is not relevant.

Final Verdict: Class 1 (1)
