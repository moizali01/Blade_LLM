LLM Response:

Class 1: This code is not needed for the basic functionality of compressing files. The code is only executed if `deleteOutputOnInterrupt` is true, which is not part of the required functionality.
Class 2: This code is not needed for the basic functionality of compressing files. The code is only executed if `deleteOutputOnInterrupt` is true, which is not part of the required functionality.
Class 3: This code is not needed for the basic functionality of compressing files. The code is only executed if `deleteOutputOnInterrupt` is true, which is not part of the required functionality.
Class 4: This code is not critical for the functionality, security, and generality of the program. The code is only executed if `deleteOutputOnInterrupt` is true, which is not part of the required functionality.

Explanation: The code snippet is only executed if `deleteOutputOnInterrupt` is true, which is not part of the required functionality. The code is related to deleting the output file if it exists, which is not a core functionality of the compression process. The code does not directly contribute to the compression algorithm or data integrity.

Final Verdict: Class 1 (1)
