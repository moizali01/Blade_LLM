Query:

if (srcMode == 3) {
  {
    saveInputFileMetaInfo(inName);
  }
}


LLM Response:

Class 1: This code might be completely unnecessary if the `saveInputFileMetaInfo` function is not essential for the compression functionality.
Class 2: This code might be somewhat unnecessary if the `saveInputFileMetaInfo` function is only used for debugging or logging purposes and does not directly impact the compression process.
Class 3: This code is necessary if the `saveInputFileMetaInfo` function is required to preserve the metadata of the input file during compression.
Class 4: This code is critical if the `saveInputFileMetaInfo` function is essential for maintaining data integrity during compression. Without it, the compressed file might not be able to be decompressed correctly.

Explanation: The code snippet is executed only when `srcMode` is 3. This mode is likely related to compressing files with metadata preservation. The `saveInputFileMetaInfo` function is likely responsible for storing the metadata of the input file. Therefore, this code is necessary for the functionality of compressing files while preserving metadata.

Final Verdict: Class 3 (3)
