LLM Response:

Class 1: This code is not directly related to the compression functionality or data integrity. It handles error messages and exit conditions.
Class 2: This code is not essential for the core compression functionality but provides a helpful error message to the user.
Class 3: This code is not directly involved in the compression process itself.
Class 4: This code is not critical for the core compression functionality or data integrity.

Explanation: The code snippet is responsible for displaying an error message and setting the exit code if a test fails. While this is helpful for user experience, it does not directly affect the compression process or data integrity. The core compression functionality would still work without this code.

Final Verdict: Class 2 (2)
