Query:

goto case_1;


LLM Response:

Class 1: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific case in a switch statement, but the case it jumps to is not relevant to the required functionality.
Class 2: This code may be needed for minor issues but does not affect overall functionality. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific case in a switch statement, but the case it jumps to is not relevant to the required functionality.
Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific case in a switch statement, which is used to determine the input and output file names based on the `srcMode` variable. This is essential for the program to correctly identify the files to be compressed.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific case in a switch statement, which is used to determine the input and output file names based on the `srcMode` variable. This is essential for the program to correctly identify the files to be compressed.

Explanation: The `goto` statement is part of a switch statement that determines the input and output file names based on the `srcMode` variable. This is essential for the program to correctly identify the files to be compressed. Removing this statement would break the program's functionality.

Final Verdict: Class 3 (3)
