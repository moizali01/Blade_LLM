Query:

fchown(fd, fileMetaInfo.st_uid, fileMetaInfo.st_gid);


LLM Response:

Class 1: This code is not needed for the functionality of compressing files. It is related to changing ownership of the output file, which is not part of the required functionality.
Class 2: This code is not needed for the functionality of compressing files. It is related to changing ownership of the output file, which is not part of the required functionality.
Class 3: This code is not needed for the functionality of compressing files. It is related to changing ownership of the output file, which is not part of the required functionality.
Class 4: This code is not needed for the functionality of compressing files. It is related to changing ownership of the output file, which is not part of the required functionality.

Explanation: The code snippet `fchown(fd, fileMetaInfo.st_uid, fileMetaInfo.st_gid);` is part of the `applySavedFileAttrToOutputFile` function, which is called after the compression process. This function applies the original file attributes (including ownership) to the compressed output file. However, our required functionality only involves compressing files and retaining data integrity. Changing the ownership of the output file is not part of this functionality. Therefore, this code snippet is not necessary for our use case.

Final Verdict: Class 1 (1)
