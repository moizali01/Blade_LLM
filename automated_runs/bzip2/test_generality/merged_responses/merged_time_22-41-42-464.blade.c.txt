Query:

goto case_2___0;


LLM Response:

Class 1: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific label, but it is not necessary for the functionality of the program.
Class 2: This code may be needed for minor issues but does not affect overall functionality. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific label, but it is not essential for the functionality of the program.
Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific label, which is necessary for the program to execute the correct code path based on the value of `srcMode`.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific label, which is essential for the program to execute the correct code path based on the value of `srcMode`. Without this statement, the program would not be able to handle different input modes correctly.

Explanation: The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific label, which is necessary for the program to execute the correct code path based on the value of `srcMode`. This statement is essential for the program to handle different input modes correctly. Without this statement, the program would not be able to handle different input modes correctly.

Final Verdict: Class 3 (3)
