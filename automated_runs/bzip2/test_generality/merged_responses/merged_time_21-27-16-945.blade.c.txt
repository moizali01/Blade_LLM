Class 1: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience. The `return;` statement is redundant as it is already at the end of the function.
Class 2: This code may be needed for minor issues but does not affect overall functionality. The `return;` statement is redundant as it is already at the end of the function.
Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. The `return;` statement is necessary to exit the function and prevent further execution of the code.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. The `return;` statement is necessary to exit the function and prevent further execution of the code.
