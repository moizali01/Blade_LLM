Query:

goto case_3;


LLM Response:

Class 1: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific label, but it is not essential for the compression functionality.
Class 2: This code may be needed for minor issues but does not affect overall functionality. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific label, but it is not essential for the compression functionality.
Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific label, which is part of the switch-case structure that determines the input and output file names based on the `srcMode`. This structure is essential for the compression functionality.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific label, which is part of the switch-case structure that determines the input and output file names based on the `srcMode`. This structure is essential for the compression functionality.

Explanation: The `goto` statement is part of a switch-case structure that determines the input and output file names based on the `srcMode`. This structure is essential for the compression functionality, as it ensures that the correct files are processed. Removing this statement would disrupt the program workflow and break the compression functionality.

Final Verdict: Class 3 (3)
