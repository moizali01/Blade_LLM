Class 1: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience. The `selector` array is not used in the provided code snippets.
Class 2: This code may be needed for minor issues but does not affect overall functionality. The `selector` array is not used in the provided code snippets.
Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. The `selector` array is declared in the `EState` structure, which is used for compression. While not directly used in the provided snippets, it is likely used in other parts of the compression process.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. The `selector` array is likely used in the compression process, and removing it could lead to incorrect compression or data corruption.
