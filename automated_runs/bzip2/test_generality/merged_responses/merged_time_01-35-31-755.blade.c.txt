Query:

parent[i] = -1;


LLM Response:

Class 1: This code might be completely unnecessary if the `parent` array is not used in the compression algorithm.
Class 2: This code might be somewhat unnecessary if the `parent` array is used for a feature that is not essential for basic compression.
Class 3: This code is necessary if the `parent` array is used in the compression algorithm, even if its purpose is not immediately clear.
Class 4: This code is critical if the `parent` array is essential for the compression algorithm and its functionality cannot be achieved without it.

Explanation: The code snippet sets the `parent` array element at index `i` to -1.  Without further context, it's impossible to determine the exact purpose of the `parent` array and its role in the compression algorithm. However, given the code's presence within the compression logic and the potential for disruption if removed, it's safer to assume it's necessary for the algorithm's functionality.

Final Verdict: Class 3 (Necessary)
