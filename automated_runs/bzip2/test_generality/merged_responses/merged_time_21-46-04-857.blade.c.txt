Class 2: This code may be needed for minor issues but does not affect overall functionality. The `goto` statement may be used to handle some edge cases, but it is not essential for the basic functionality of the program.
Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. The `goto` statement is used to jump out of a loop, which is necessary for the program to function correctly.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. The `goto` statement is used to jump out of a loop, which is essential for the program to function correctly. The loop is used to process data, and the `goto` statement is used to exit the loop when the data has been processed.
