Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. The code is a jump statement that is used to handle errors during the compression process.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. The code is a jump statement that is used to handle errors during the compression process. It is essential for the program to handle errors gracefully and prevent unexpected behavior.

Explanation: The code snippet `goto errhandler;` is a jump statement that is used to handle errors during the compression process. It is essential for the program to handle errors gracefully and prevent unexpected behavior. The `errhandler` label likely contains code that cleans up resources and provides an appropriate error message to the user.
