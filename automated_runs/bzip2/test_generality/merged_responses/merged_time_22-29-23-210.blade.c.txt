LLM Response:

Class 1: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific point in the code, but it is not essential for the compression functionality.
Class 2: This code may be needed for minor issues but does not affect overall functionality. The `goto` statement could be replaced with a more structured approach, but it does not significantly impact the program's functionality.
Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific point in the code, which is necessary for the compression functionality.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific point in the code, which is essential for the compression functionality. The program will not work without it.

Explanation: The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific point in the code, which is necessary for the compression functionality. The program will not work without it. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific point in the code, which is essential for the compression functionality. The program will not work without it.
