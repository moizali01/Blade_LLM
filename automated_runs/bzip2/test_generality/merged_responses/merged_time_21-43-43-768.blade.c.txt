Query:

if (srcMode == 2) {
  goto case_2;
}


LLM Response:

Class 1: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific label within the switch statement, but the code snippet itself does not perform any actions.
Class 2: This code may be needed for minor issues but does not affect overall functionality. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific label within the switch statement, but the code snippet itself does not perform any actions.
Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific label within the switch statement, which is essential for the program's workflow.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific label within the switch statement, which is essential for the program's workflow.

Explanation: The code snippet is part of a switch statement that handles different modes of operation. The `goto` statement is used to jump to the `case_2` label, which corresponds to a specific mode. Removing this code would disrupt the program's workflow and prevent it from correctly handling the `srcMode == 2` case.

Final Verdict: Class 3 (3)
