        (char const * /* __restrict  */) "\n%s: Data integrity error "
                                         "when decompressing.\n",

LLM Response:

Class 1: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience. The code is related to decompression, which is not a required functionality.
Class 2: This code may be needed for minor issues but does not affect overall functionality. The code is related to decompression, which is not a required functionality.
Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. The code is related to decompression, which is not a required functionality.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. This code is related to decompression, which is not a required functionality.

Explanation: The code snippet is part of the `crcError` function, which is called when a CRC error is detected during decompression. Since decompression is not a required functionality, this code is not essential for the program's core functionality.

Final Verdict: Class 1 (1)
