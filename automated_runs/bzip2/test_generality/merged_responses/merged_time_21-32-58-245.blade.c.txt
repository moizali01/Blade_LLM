LLM Response:

Class 1: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience. The code is only related to the deletion of the input file, which is not a core functionality of the program.
Class 2: This code may be needed for minor issues but does not affect overall functionality. The code handles the deletion of the input file, which is a minor feature and does not affect the core compression functionality.
Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. The code is responsible for deleting the input file after successful compression, which is a core functionality of the program.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. The code is not critical for the core functionality of the program. It is only responsible for deleting the input file, which is not essential for the program to function.

Explanation: The code snippet is responsible for deleting the input file after successful compression. This is a minor feature that does not affect the core functionality of the program. The program can still function without this code, but it will not delete the input file after compression.

Final Verdict: Class 2 (2)
