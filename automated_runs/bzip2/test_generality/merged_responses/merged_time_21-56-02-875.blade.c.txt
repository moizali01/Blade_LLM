Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. The code snippet is used to display an error message to the user, which is not required for our functionality. However, it is necessary to keep the code snippet as it is part of the code execution path for the required functionality.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. The code snippet is used to display an error message to the user, which is not required for our functionality. However, it is necessary to keep the code snippet as it is part of the code execution path for the required functionality.

Explanation: The code snippet is used to display an error message to the user, which is not required for our functionality. However, it is necessary to keep the code snippet as it is part of the code execution path for the required functionality. Removing this code snippet would disrupt the program workflow and potentially lead to unexpected behavior.
