Query:

showFileNames();


LLM Response:

Class 1: This code might be completely unnecessary if the program does not require displaying file names to the user.
Class 2: This code might be somewhat unnecessary if the program only needs to display file names in specific scenarios, but not in all cases.
Class 3: This code is necessary if the program requires displaying file names to the user, especially for debugging or informational purposes.
Class 4: This code is not critical for the program's functionality, security, or generality. The program will not break without it.

Explanation: The `showFileNames()` function appears to be responsible for displaying the names of files being processed. While this information might be helpful for debugging or user feedback, it is not essential for the core compression functionality or data integrity. The program can still function correctly without this code.

Final Verdict: Class 3 (Necessary)
