Query:

if (srcMode == 2) {
  goto case_2;
}


LLM Response:

Class 1: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience. The code is a jump statement that is part of a switch-case structure. The switch-case structure is used to determine the source mode, which is used to determine the input and output files. The code snippet is only used to jump to the case_2 label, which is not relevant to the required functionality.
Class 2: This code may be needed for minor issues but does not affect overall functionality. The code is a jump statement that is part of a switch-case structure. The switch-case structure is used to determine the source mode, which is used to determine the input and output files. The code snippet is only used to jump to the case_2 label, which is not relevant to the required functionality.
Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. The code is a jump statement that is part of a switch-case structure. The switch-case structure is used to determine the source mode, which is used to determine the input and output files. The code snippet is used to jump to the case_2 label, which is relevant to the required functionality.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. The code is a jump statement that is part of a switch-case structure. The switch-case structure is used to determine the source mode, which is used to determine the input and output files. The code snippet is used to jump to the case_2 label, which is relevant to the required functionality.

Explanation: The code snippet is part of a switch-case structure that is used to determine the source mode. The source mode is used to determine the input and output files. The code snippet is used to jump to the case_2 label, which is relevant to the required functionality. The code snippet is necessary for the program to function correctly.

Final Verdict: Class 3 (3)
