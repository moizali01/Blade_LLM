Class 2: This code may be needed for minor issues but does not affect overall functionality. The `goto` statement is used to jump back to the beginning of the loop, but it is not essential for the functionality of the program.
Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. The `goto` statement is used to jump back to the beginning of the loop, which is essential for the functionality of the program.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. The `goto` statement is used to jump back to the beginning of the loop, which is essential for the functionality of the program.

Explanation: The `goto` statement is used to jump back to the beginning of the loop, which is essential for the functionality of the program. Without it, the loop would not be able to iterate properly, and the program would not be able to compress files.
