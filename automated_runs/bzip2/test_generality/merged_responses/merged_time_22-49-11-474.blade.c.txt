Query:

goto case_1;


LLM Response:

Class 1: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific label within the code, but it is not essential for the compression functionality.
Class 2: This code may be needed for minor issues but does not affect overall functionality. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific label within the code, but it is not essential for the compression functionality.
Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific label within the code, which is essential for the program's workflow and functionality.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific label within the code, which is essential for the program's workflow and functionality.

Explanation: The `goto` statement is used to jump to a specific label within the code, which is essential for the program's workflow and functionality. It is part of a switch statement that determines the input and output file names based on the `srcMode` variable. Removing this statement would disrupt the program's flow and potentially lead to incorrect file handling.

Final Verdict: Class 3 (3)
