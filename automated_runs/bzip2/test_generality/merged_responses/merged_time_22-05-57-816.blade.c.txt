Query:

showFileNames();


LLM Response:

Class 1: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience. It is not related to compression or data integrity.
Class 2: This code may be needed for minor issues but does not affect overall functionality. It is not related to compression or data integrity.
Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. It is not directly related to compression or data integrity, but it is called within the `outOfMemory` function, which is used to handle memory allocation errors during compression.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. It is not related to compression or data integrity.

Explanation: The `showFileNames()` function is called within the `outOfMemory` function, which is used to handle memory allocation errors during compression. While it is not directly related to compression or data integrity, it is important for providing information about the files being processed in case of an error. Removing this function would make it difficult to debug memory allocation issues.

Final Verdict: Class 3 (3)
