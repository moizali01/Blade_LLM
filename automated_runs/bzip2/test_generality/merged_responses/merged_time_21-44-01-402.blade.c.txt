Query:

if (srcMode == 1) {
  goto case_1;
}


LLM Response:

Class 1: This code is not needed for functionality or user experience. The code is a jump statement and does not directly contribute to the compression functionality.
Class 2: This code may be needed for minor issues but does not affect overall functionality. The code is a jump statement and does not directly contribute to the compression functionality.
Class 3: This code is important for the basic functionality of the program. The code is a jump statement and is essential for the program's control flow. Removing it would disrupt the program's execution.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. The code is a jump statement and is essential for the program's control flow. Removing it would disrupt the program's execution.

Explanation: The code snippet is a jump statement that directs the program flow based on the value of `srcMode`. This is crucial for the program's logic and functionality. Removing it would disrupt the program's execution and potentially lead to unexpected behavior.

Final Verdict: Class 3 (3)
