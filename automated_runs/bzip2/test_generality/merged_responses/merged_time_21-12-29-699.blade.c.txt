This is essential for the functionality of the program, as it allows the program to handle cases where the input is not recognized.
Class 4: This code is essential for functionality, security, and generality. The program will break without it. The `goto switch_default` statement is used to jump to the default case of the `switch` statement. This is essential for the functionality of the program, as it allows the program to handle cases where the input is not recognized.
