**Required Functionality:**

1. bzip2 is used only without any flag to compress all kind of files with varying extensions.
2. Retain the data integrity after compression and make sure the compression occurs successfully. 
3. For compression Burrows-Wheeler transform is used to reorder data, and Huffman coding is used to efficiently represent the reordered data.

**Unrequired Functionality:**

1. **-d, --decompress**:  Forces decompression, which is not needed as we want to compress files.
2. **-h, --help**:  Displays help information, which is not needed for our use case.
3. **-L, --license**:  Displays software version and license, which is not relevant to compression functionality.
4. **-V, --version**:  Displays software version and license, which is not relevant to compression functionality.
5. **-s, --small**:  Uses less memory, which is not a priority for our use case.
6. **-1 .. -9, --fast, --best**:  Sets block size, which is not relevant to our use case as we want to compress all files without specific block size requirements.
7. **-t, --test**:  Tests compressed file integrity, which is not needed as we want to ensure successful compression.
8. **-q, --quiet**:  Suppresses noncritical error messages, which is not needed as we want to be aware of any issues during compression.
9. **-v, --verbose**:  Provides verbose output, which is not needed as we only want to ensure successful compression. 
10. **-c, --stdout**:  Outputs to standard output, which is not needed as we want to compress files to their respective compressed versions. 
11. **-k, --keep**:  Keeps input files, which is not needed as we are not concerned with deleting input files.
12. **-f, --force**:  Overwrites existing output files, which is not needed as we are not concerned with overwriting existing files.
