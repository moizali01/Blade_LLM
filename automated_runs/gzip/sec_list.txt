**Return Code Validation**: Ensure that all functions exit with the correct return code, which is crucial for proper error handling and for the program to react appropriately to various situations.
**Data Integrity Errors**: Prevent data corruption or loss by ensuring the program accurately detects and responds to integrity check failures, such as corrupted data or invalid CRC values.
**Buffer Overflows**: Protect against security vulnerabilities and potential system crashes by ensuring the program handles input data that exceeds buffer sizes without causing overflows.
**Memory Leaks**: Ensure efficient resource management by confirming that all memory allocated by the program is properly released, especially after encountering errors, to avoid memory leaks.
**Input File Corruption**: Prevent undefined behavior or data corruption by ensuring the program can detect and handle corrupted or incomplete input files effectively.
**Output File Corruption**: Protect the integrity of the program's output by ensuring that it can detect and respond appropriately to cases where the output file becomes corrupted or incomplete.
**Memory Allocation Errors**: Prevent crashes or instability by ensuring the program can handle memory allocation failures gracefully, especially in scenarios involving very large files or limited memory resources.
**File Name Manipulation**: Avoid potential crashes, security vulnerabilities, or unexpected behavior by ensuring the program can correctly handle file names that contain special characters, are excessively long, or otherwise problematic.
**File Permissions**: Prevent unauthorized access or operation failures by ensuring the program properly respects file permissions and handles cases where it lacks the necessary rights to perform certain actions.
**Buffer Overflows**: Safeguard against potential security exploits and program crashes by ensuring the program doesnâ€™t allow data to overflow buffers, especially in functions dealing with input/output.
