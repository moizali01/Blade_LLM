**Required Functionality:**

Recursive Ownership/Group Change (-R):

   Support for -R flag to recursively traverse and change ownership and/or group of directories and ALL their contents, including nested directories and their files.
   Handle OWNER and :[GROUP] arguments, including numeric and symbolic owner/group specifications.
   Correctly resolve and apply symbolic or numeric user and group names, including retrieving user/group names from user IDs (UID) and group IDs (GID), or converting numeric identifiers back into human-readable names.
   Logic for correctly parsing arguments related to the -R flag and user and group arguments.
   All logic relevant to recursively traversing and changing directory ownership and group.

   IMPORTANT: Make sure to cater all edge-cases relevant to -R Flag Recursive Traversal and User,Group functionality since these are the most important things.

**Unrequired Functionality:**

Any other functionality that does not contribute to the above-mentioned core features is irrelevant. Examples include code responsible for help messages, verbosity (-v, -f, etc.), or other unrelated flags.

For example:
- A code snippet that is responsible for printing help or user information is not a part of required functionalities mentioned above, hence it must be classified as class 1.
- A code snippet that is responsible for --reference or -H functionality is not a part of the Required functionalities mentioned above, hence it must be classified as class 1.
- A code snippet implementing the -c, -f, or -v flags, which only affect output verbosity is not a part of required functionalities mentioned above, hence it must be classified as class 1.

Hence, any other code snippets responsible for tasks unrelated to the mentioned task should be marked as unnecessary.
