Buffer Overflow: The program uses buffers for storing data. Ensure that the program does not overflow these buffers to prevent potential vulnerabilities.
Environment Variables: The program may use environment variables. Ensure that the program does not rely on potentially insecure environment variables or allow attackers to manipulate them.
Input Validation: The program parses command-line arguments and input files. Ensure that the program properly validates input to prevent potential buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or other injection attacks.
Error Handling: The code should include robust error handling to ensure proper handling of exceptions and prevent unexpected behavior.The code should include robust error handling to ensure proper handling of exceptions and prevent unexpected behavior.
Memory Management: The program uses dynamic memory allocation. Ensure that the program correctly allocates and frees memory to prevent memory leaks or dangling pointers.
Data Integrity: The program performs data transformations and comparisons. Ensure that the program maintains data integrity and does not introduce vulnerabilities that could lead to data corruption or manipulation.
Resource Exhaustion: The program can potentially exhaust system resources like memory, file descriptors, or CPU time, especially when dealing with large input files.
File Descriptor Limits: The program uses file descriptors for input and output streams. Exceeding the system's file descriptor limit can lead to errors.
