- **Buffer Overflow:** Test cases with extremely long lines or large input files to check for potential buffer overflows and ensure memory safety.
- **File System Errors:** Test cases involving invalid file paths, non-existent files, or files with restricted permissions to ensure the program handles errors gracefully.
- **Input Validation:** Test cases with invalid input formats, special characters, or malicious data to ensure the program performs input validation and sanitization.
- **Output Validation:** Test cases with specific input data to verify the correctness and consistency of the output generated by the program.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Test cases with large input files or a high number of files to check for potential memory leaks or excessive memory usage.
- **File Descriptor Limits:** Test cases that exceed the maximum number of open file descriptors to verify the program's behavior and error handling.
- **Race Conditions:** Test cases involving concurrent access to temporary files or shared resources to identify potential race conditions and ensure thread safety.
- **Signal Handling:** Test cases that trigger signals like SIGINT, SIGTERM, or SIGSEGV to verify the program's signal handling mechanisms and ensure proper cleanup.
- **Temporary File Security:** Test cases that attempt to access or modify temporary files created by the program to ensure proper permissions and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Locale-Specific Issues:** Test cases with different locales to ensure the program handles locale-specific sorting rules and character encoding correctly.
- **Integer Overflow:** Test cases involving large numbers or file sizes to verify the program's handling of integer values and prevent potential overflows.
- **Command Injection:** Test cases that attempt to inject malicious commands through input arguments or environment variables to ensure the program prevents command injection vulnerabilities.
- **Symbolic Links:** Test cases involving symbolic links to ensure the program handles them correctly and prevents potential security issues.
- **File System Permissions:** Test cases that attempt to create or modify files in directories with restricted permissions to verify the program's behavior and error handling.
- **Time-of-Check-to-Time-of-Use (TOCTOU):** Test cases that exploit the time difference between checking file permissions and using them to identify potential TOCTOU vulnerabilities.
- **Fork Bomb:** Test cases that attempt to trigger a fork bomb by exploiting the program's forking behavior to ensure it prevents such attacks.
- **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Test cases with large input files or excessive requests to check for potential DoS vulnerabilities and ensure the program's resilience.
- **Memory Corruption:** Test cases that attempt to trigger memory corruption vulnerabilities through invalid memory access or pointer manipulation.
- **Data Integrity:** Test cases that verify the integrity of the sorted output to ensure the program does not introduce errors or data corruption.
- **Environment Variables:** Test cases that manipulate environment variables to check for potential security issues and ensure the program does not rely on untrusted environment variables.
