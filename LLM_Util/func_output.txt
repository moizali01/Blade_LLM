## Required Functionality:

**Functionality 1:** 
    * **Command:** `tar -cf archive.tar -C temp .`
    * **Purpose:** This command, executed by the REDUCED_BINARY, creates a new tar archive file named "archive.tar". It includes all files and directories present within the "temp" directory. The "-C temp" flag indicates that the tar command should change its working directory to "temp" before creating the archive. 
    * 
## Unrequired Functionality (to be removed):

1. **Handling of file attributes:** The provided script doesn't utilize or test any functionalities related to preserving or modifying file attributes like ownership, permissions, or timestamps.
2. **Device selection and switching:** The script focuses on creating archives on the local file system and doesn't involve any functionalities related to tape drives, remote hosts, or multi-volume archives.
3. **Device blocking:**  The script doesn't utilize or test functionalities related to specifying blocking factors, record sizes, or handling sparse files.
4. **Archive format selection:** The script doesn't explicitly specify any particular archive format for creation. It relies on the default format of the REDUCED_BINARY.
5. **Local file selection:** While the script uses "-C" for changing directories, it doesn't utilize other functionalities like excluding specific files, handling symbolic links, or limiting the archive creation to a single file system.
