Here is the train oracle for a a program we are debloating. It contains the functionality that is required: 

#####

**Oracle:** 
{train_oracle}

Make sure to only focus on the functionality being performed by the *REDUCED_BINARY* as part of the functionality. *ORG_BINARY* is just for comparison and we must not consider that as a part of our program's required functionality. 

#####

Here is a list of all the functionalities present in this utility:

#####

**Functionalities:**

{functionality_list}

#####

*IMPORTANT:* This task is about the functionality of REDUCED_BINARY inside the run() function. Any reference to **ORG_BINARY** is only for comparison purposes and must be completely ignored when determining required and unrequired functionalities.

You must ONLY focus on REDUCED_BINARY. Treat any command run by ORG_BINARY as irrelevant to the required functionalities. Be cautious not to mix up the binaries when analyzing the cases.

Task: Make a list of required and unrequired functionalities of the REDUCED_BINARY only. Follow the specific format below:

**Required Functionality:**

    Functionality: Clearly describe the functionality of REDUCED_BINARY, including any specific flags used, completely ignore any command being run by **ORG_BINARY** in this section.
    Purpose: Clearly state the purpose of this command as seen in the run() function.
    Reasoning: Specify which test case from the train oracle is using this functionality of the REDUCED_BINARY.

**Unrequired Functionality (to be removed):**

    <Unrequired functionality No. 1>
    <Unrequired functionality No. 2>
    <Unrequired functionality No. 3>
    Any functionality that is not listed in the required functionality.

Do not list or describe any command related to ORG_BINARY as required functionality. Focus exclusively on the REDUCED_BINARY. Do not include unnecessary details or explanations unless they are related to the REDUCED_BINARY. 

Parsing and formats: If the REDUCED_BINARY relies on any specific parsing or formatting operations, be sure to mention these details in the required functionality section.

*Reminder:* There should be no overlap between the required and unrequired functionality. Make sure that no ORG_BINARY commands are incorrectly considered part of the REDUCED_BINARY's required functionality. Additionally, make sure to keep the unrequired functionality list upto 5 points.ionaly
