Here is the train oracle for a a program we are debloating. It contains the functionality that is required: 

#####

**Oracle:** 
{train_oracle}

Make sure to only focus on the functionality being performed by the *REDUCED_BINARY* as part of the functionality. *ORG_BINARY* is just for comparison and we must not consider that as a part of our program's required functionality. 

#####

Here is a list of all the functionalities present in this utility:

#####

**Functionalities:**

{functionality_list}

#####

Now, your task is to make a list of required and unrequired functionalities of the *REDUCED_BINARY* as shown below:

Use the functionalities list to properly describe the required and unrequired functionalities. 

#######

**Required Functionality**:

Functionality: <Describe the functionality of the *REDUCED_BINARY* (including any flags that are used) as shown in the training oracle above>
Purpose: <Describe the purpose of the *REDUCED_BINARY* as observed in the training oracle above>
Reasoning: <Describe which test case we are using this functionality in>

**Undesired Functionality (to be removed):**

1. <unrequired functionality No.1>
2. <unrequired functionality No.2>
3. <unrequired functionality No.3>
4. Any thing apart from what is listed in the required functionality

#######

Strictly follow the answer format shown above. Make sure to keep the undesired functionality list upto 5 points. Properly describe each unrequired functionality in a concise manner. 

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure there is no overlap in the required and unrequired functionality. Carefully analyse the cases being performed by *REDUCED_BINARY* in the *compress_and_decompress()* function of the train oracle. Do not focus on the *ORG_BINARY* in the function since it is only used for comparison purpose. Make sure the list is not too long and is concise.

Make sure you do not add any information on your own. Do not fabricate an answer. Only answer on the basis of the training oracle and functionalities shown above.
