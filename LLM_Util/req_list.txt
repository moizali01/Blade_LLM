**Required Functionality:**

Removal of duplicate lines from a file:

1. Use of this core-utility without any flags to remove duplicate lines from sorted files. 
2. Proper input processing from a file. We will take input by reading lines from a file which is a necessary feature.
3. Proper output processing. We will output the results to standard out. 

**Unrequired Functionality:**

Any other functionality that does not contribute to the above-mentioned core features is irrelevant. Choosing different options to choose criteria for filtering unique lines, or to display any other information other than the basic main filtering capabilities of the uniq core utility is unrequired.
If you encounter a code snippet make sure to think about whether it is a part of the required or unrequired functionality by thinking like the following examples:

- A code snippet that is responsible for printing help or user information is not a part of required functionalities mentioned above, hence it must be classified as class 1.
- A code snippet that is responsible for -c, --count (prefix lines by the number of occurrences functionality) is not a part of the Required functionalities mentioned above, hence it must be classified as class 1.
- A code snippet that is responsible for filtering uniq lines based on a particular delimiter is considered unnecessary

Hence, any other code snippets responsible for tasks unrelated to the mentioned task should be marked as unnecessary.

Please use the following examples to help you streamline the thought process.
Class 1: A piece of code that is directly a part of any unrequired functionalities such as displaying version information or counting unique occurances is completely unnecessary.
Class 2: A piece of code that is comparing lines may or may not be required. If the code snippet is used with extra constaints such as ignore case or skip characters, the code snippet would not directly be a part of our required functionality
Class 3: A piece of code that is setting environment variables, handling or ensuring the control flow of the program is disrupted minimally in the context of the larger required functionality of removing duplicate lines.
Class 4: A piece of code that employs the core logic of the required functionality within directly within the appropriate context as well.
